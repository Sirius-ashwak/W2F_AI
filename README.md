### About Savour

Food waste squanders critical land and water resources and creates unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions in the context of a cost of living crisis. This is not just an economic issue - it is an environmental challenge that demands innovative solutions. 

Savour confronts food waste at the source, turning the problem into an opportunity for sustainable and healthy living. By reimagining how households interact with ingredients, recipes, and their environmental footprint, Savour leverages cutting-edge AI to transform your kitchen into a smart, eco-friendly hub.
