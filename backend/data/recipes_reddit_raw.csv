https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/juk0jo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/juk0jo,reddit,"This traditional Polish stew goes back to the times of kings. Bigos Królewski was eaten only by the nobility who could afford exotic spices. A poor men's version of this dish was called Bigos Hultajski and had more cabbage than anything else. Luckily we live in the times when spices and meat are available widely. So let's get cooking!

For this recipe, I use slow-cooker but you can also simmer it on the stove.

**Ingredients:**

* 400g (14.1oz) of stewing diced beef (chuck, skirt, leg or flank)
* 250g (8.8oz) of kiełbasa (I used podwawelska but any smoked sausage will do just fine)
* 150g (5.3oz) of lardons ( chopped bacon also can be used)
* 500g (17.6oz) of sauerkraut
* 500g (17.6oz) of white cabbage sliced
* a handful of dried boletus mushrooms
* 2-3 prunes ( 6 if using canned)
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 apple diced
* 2 bay leaf
* 4 allspice berries
* 2tsp of marjoram
* 1tsp of caraway
* 1tsp of honey
* 2tsp of salt
* 0,5tsp ground black pepper
* pinch of nutmeg
* 1tbsp of tomato puree
* 1 glass of dry red wine
* 1L (1.05quarts) of water

📷📷📷

**Method:**

**1.** Begin by hydrating the mushrooms in **1L** of boiling water for around **15 minutes**. When ready remove the mushrooms and pour the water to slow-cooker dish leaving behind the last **50ml** of water (usually contains sand).

**2.** In the frying pan, sear the lardons and sausage, use high heat and do so until browned. Transfer meat to the slow-cooker leaving fat in the pan.

**3.** In the same pan brown the diced onions then transfer to the slow-cooker.

**4.** Next, brown the diced beef, do it in two batches then transfer to the crockpot.

**5.** Add all the remaining ingredients and cover with a lid, set the slow-cooker on high heat for **5 hours**. After the first hour give it a good stir, you can repeat string every now and then (I love the aroma so I check every hour :)

**6.** When the bigos is ready, serve with sourdough bread or boiled potatoes. You can store it in the fridge for up to **three days**. You can also freeze it if you make a bigger batch.

📷📷

**Insight:**

* Bigos tastes better when reheated on the next day, this applies to many meat dishes as with time protein breaks down to tasty amino acids like glutamate bringing more umami flavours.
* Meat searing needs to be done quickly and in high temperature to prevent it from losing the juices from the inside of a cut, cooking meat in smaller batches can help to achieve that.

Over Thanksgiving, I made homemade ravioli for the first time and it was amazing! For the big day, I decided on a homemade crab ravioli recipe.

For this homemade crab ravioli, you can serve it with any sauce you like. You can do a light tomato sauce, but for this crab ravioli, a delicate sauce would be more fitting. Try it with a lemon butter sauce, or a parmesan butter sauce. Basically, anything with butter!

That said, since it was Thanksgiving, I would be remiss to not include cranberries, so I made a savory cranberry sauce, which was pretty interesting to say the least. I think I would have preferred a lemon butter sauce, though!

# Grade:

Serves: 2 as a large entrée or 4 as a small appetizer

Cost: *Price will vary dependent upon market price of crab*

Skill Level: Intermediate

Time to Make: About 2 hours (40 minutes inactive)

# Ingredients for Homemade Crab Ravioli Recipe

**Crab Ravioli Filling:**

1 pound jumbo lump crab meat, picked over for any shells

1/2 cup ricotta cheese

Juice of 1/2 a lemon

Crushed red pepper to taste

Salt and pepper to taste

**Ravioli:**

1 egg

3 egg yolks

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 cup all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon olive oil

# Method

**Prepare the Filling:**

1. In a bowl combine the crab, ricotta, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper and mix gently to combine. Do not over mix. Transfer to the refrigerator until ready to use.

**Prepare the Ravioli Dough:**

1. In a food processor, combine the egg, egg yolks, salt, and olive oil and pulse until creamy and combined. Add half the flour and pulse to combine. Add the remaining flour and continue pulsing until combined.
2. If the dough seems too dry, add a few splashes of water. The dough should be sticky but still hold together.

**Finish the Dough:**

1. Pour the dough on to a floured surface and knead until you form the dough into a smooth, elastic ball, about 7-8 minutes total. Wrap with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes to chill.

**Roll the Dough:**

1. Cut the dough ball into 4 equal-sized pieces.
2. Using your hands, flatten each piece into an equal sized rectangle and dust with flour.
3. Run the first piece through a pasta machine on the widest setting (0). Dust liberally with more flour on both sides and fold the dough in half and run through the pasta machine on the widest setting again. Unfold and dust with flour again.
4. Continue passing the dough through the machine, incrementally decreasing the width on the machine until you reach level 6 on the machine. Be sure to dust the dough between passes. The sheet of pasta should be thin but not breaking apart; you should be able to see your fingers through it.
5. Once you have a very long sheet, lay it down on a floured surface. I used a ravioli stamp, but you can also use a knife.
6. Meanwhile, roll out another piece of dough into another long piece, similar to the previous sheet. Place on a floured surface until needed.

**Form the Ravioli:**

1. Using a tablespoon, spoon the ravioli filling equidistant apart on the sheet of dough. You want about 2” of clear space around the filling. You will likely have about 8 spoonfuls of filling across the sheet of dough.
2. Carefully lay the second sheet of dough on top of the first sheet, lining it up as much as possible.
3. Using your fingers, press the dough around the filling to push out any air pockets. You want the top layer of dough to adhere as tightly to the filling and the bottom layer of dough as possible.
4. Using a stamp, knife, or even a round cookie cutter, cut the ravioli out and discard the leftover dough,.
5. Continue on with the remaining 2 pieces of dough until you have used up all the filling. *Note: If you have any leftover filling, you can add some panko to it and fry it up for delicious crab balls!*

**Cook or Freeze the Ravioli:**

1. At this point, you may either cook or freeze the ravioli. If freezing the ravioli, transfer them to a floured sheet pan and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Transfer to a ziplock bag and then transfer to the freezer for up to 3 months. *Note: Frozen ravioli may require a few additional minutes boiling.*
2. If cooking, simply bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook for 3-6 minutes or until the ravioli float to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve with a sauce of your choice. *Note: Do not dump into a colander or the ravioli will break (I learned the hard way, trust me).*"

Taco Bell came out with a chicken biscuit taco in the spring of 2015 and promptly discontinued it. In college and a frequent visitor of taco bell at the time, I only had this once and thought it was one of their best items before being discontinued.

Well today, I made my own version that is sure to blow Taco Bell's version out of the water. The crispiness from the chicken, the fluffiness of the biscuit and the spicy sweetness of the jalapeno honey...this is it chief.

# - RECIPE -

# Chicken Strips

***Ingredients:***

**Chicken Batter**

* 1 Chicken breast, cut into tender sized pieces
* 1 Egg, beaten
* 1 TSP Soy Sauce
* 2 TBSP Cornstarch

**Breading:**

* ½ cup flour
* 1 TSP Smoked Paprika
* Pinch of Cayenne
* Salt & Pepper to Taste

***Method:***

Mix the chicken, egg, soy, and cornstarch into a light batter.

Add the breading ingredients to a large ziploc bag.  Add the battered chicken to the to breading bag and shake.

Deep or shallow fry the breaded chicken in 325 - 350 degree oil until floating and golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

# Biscuit Taco

***Ingredients (you can double this recipe if needed):***

* 1.25 cups flour
* ¼ cup unsalted butter (½ stick), frozen
* ½ cup buttermilk
* 2 TBSP pickled jalapenos, minced

***Method:***

Grate the frozen butter. Loosely mix the flour and the butter until a crumbly mixture forms. Move the flour / butter mixture to freezer and chill for 10 minutes. **Note: This is important because we do not want the butter to melt. We want it to melt during the cooking.**

Once chilled, create a small valley in the flour mixture. Add the buttermilk and jalapenos.  Mix until the dough starts to form and pulls away from the bowl. Turn the dough onto a floured counter.

Using a rolling pin roll out to ½ inch thick. Fold the dough in half and rolled to ½ inch thick. Repeat 3 times. **Note: This will create layers in the biscuit dough for flakey goodness.**

Cut the biscuits into 3 inch squares (I got 4 or 5 out of it). Lay a sheet of folded tin foil onto a square and fold in half to create a taco type shape.

Lay on a baking sheet and bake in a 450 degree oven for 10-13 minutes until lightly browned.

# Jalapeno Honey

***Ingredients:***

* 1 TBSP Honey
* 1 TSP pickled jalapeno liquid

***Method:***

Mix the ingredients to desired consistency.

Assemble and enjoy!"

Buffalo Style Wings

2 chicken breasts boneless skinless

1 cup flour

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

1 large egg

1 cup whole milk

canola oil for frying

2 cups  buffalo wing sauce (since I made a another flavor I only used 1 cup of buffalo sauce)

In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, salt and pepper and in a second bowl whisk the egg and milk together.

Cut the chicken into two inch chunks then dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture then the flour mixture, then back to the egg, then back to the flour then rest on a cookie sheet for 20 minutes.

Heat three inches of canola oil to 375 degrees in a large dutch oven when you are ready to fry.

Add 6-8 pieces of chicken at a time to the oil and fry for 5-6 minutes until cooked through  then remove to a clean cookie sheet and when all the chicken is done toss with the buffalo chicken wing sauce.

*edit* I also want to add that- I did have to add extra flour when breading the chicken so keep that in mind.


Garlic Parmesan Sauce: this recipe is my own interpretation of a recipe I found online, I didn't have all the ingredients for the original. 

1/4c. Melted Butter
 
1/4-1/2c. Grated Parmesan Cheese 

1/4 t. Minced garlic

1/4 t. Minced onion 

1/4 t. Salt

1/8 t. Pepper

1 t. Dried parsley 

Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl and toss wings in bowl.

*Edit* after tasting the garlic parmesan I would probably add more minced garlic, maybe double."

it's kinda like rigatoni lasagna; very comforting and rich! I think pasta al forno may typically have pork, veal, or sausage in it...I made mine with mushrooms, but you can add whatever meat you want. just cook it first, then do the mushrooms, and so on...and add the cooked meat back with the tomatoes.

**Mushroom-tomato sauce:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, plus more if needed
* 1 pound mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

* 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 8-ounce jar tomato sauce of choice
* Pinch of sugar
* 10 basil leaves, roughly chopped
* 1/3 cup fresh parsley, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Béchamel:**

* 1/4 cup butter
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 2 1/2 cups whole milk, warmed in the microwave for 1–2 minutes
* Pinch of white pepper
* Salt

**For assembly:**

* 16 ounces rigatoni
* 6 ounces grated mozzarella
* 4 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Fresh basil, for serving

**Prepare the mushroom-tomato sauce:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. heat neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add half the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes until they turn golden brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl. Add a bit more oil and the remaining mushrooms, and cook an additional 8–10 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of mushrooms.
3. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 5–6 minutes until it begins to soften. Return the mushrooms to the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, and a big pinch of crushed red pepper.
4. Turn the heat to high, and as soon as the mushrooms begin sizzling hard in the pot (be careful not to burn them!), pour in the sweet vermouth. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for 3–4 minutes.
5. Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce to the pot and bring to a boil. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Reduce heat and stir in the basil and parsley. Simmer, uncovered, for 30–40 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add 3/4 of the sauce from the pot and toss to coat. Set aside.

2. Add a ladle of the milk and whisk constantly until a slurry forms. Continue ladling in the milk, whisking after each addition, until all the milk has been incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Simmer over medium-low for 5–10 minutes or until the béchamel is thick. Season with white pepper and salt. Turn off the heat.

**Assemble the casserole:**

1. Add half the remaining sauce to the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Add half the pasta and smooth it into an even layer. Pour half the béchamel on top. Sprinkle with half the mozzarella and half the Parmigiano-Reggiano.
2. Pour the remaining half of the pasta on top and cover with the remaining sauce. Use the back of your spoon to smooth everything into an even layer. Finish with the remaining béchamel and smooth it out. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Finish with freshly cracked black pepper.

**Bake the pasta:**

1. Transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes until bubbly. At the end of cooking, turn on the broiler and broil the top for 1–2 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let stand 5–10 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Sprinkle fresh basil on top of the pasta and serve. Enjoy!"

* Remove bread from oven and let cool completely. Cut into 10 equal slices and cover slices with cling wrap. For best texture, wait overnight but at least a couple hours. Slather on some almond butter and enjoy!

* Fresh basil leaves - for garnish (optional)

# Prepare the Fresh Tomato Reduction:

1. Place the tomatoes in a large pot or bowl. Pour boiling water over them, ensuring they are fully submerged. Leave for **10-15 minutes** until the skins start to break.
2. Remove the tomatoes from the water, peel off the skins, and chop them, discarding the hard white core.
3. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 30 ml of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped tomatoes, salt, and dried oregano.
4. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for **1-1.5 hours**, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce thickens.

# Cook the Sausages and Pasta:

1. While the tomato reduction is simmering, heat 1-2 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onions and sauté until soft and translucent, about **5 minutes**.
2. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add the sliced sausages to the skillet and cook until browned and fully cooked, about **8-10 minutes**. Set aside.
4. Cook the spaghetti in a pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.

# Combine and Serve:

1. Add the sausage mixture to the tomato reduction, and stir to combine. If the sauce is too thick, use a little reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency.
2. Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce and toss to coat well.
3. Serve hot, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and fresh basil leaves if desired.

One of the things I've missed most during the pandemic is cooking for people. It's a fun recipe to make for company because once everything is prepped, the cooking part goes really fast. We just ate it with bread and salad but it's great mixed with pasta.  
More about it [here](https://nerdswithknives.com/the-most-delicious-garlic-butter-shrimp-scampi/).  
Serves about 4  
1 - 1 1/2 pounds extra-large (U 26/30) shrimp, peeled and deveined  
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste  
1/4 teaspoon baking soda  
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided  
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling  
3 medium shallots, finely diced (about 1 1/4 cups)  
5 large cloves garlic, minced  
Pinch red pepper flakes, optional  
Freshly ground black pepper  
3/4 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth  
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)  
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)  
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley leaves  
Directions  
Dry the shrimp and add them to a medium bowl; toss well with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. Return to the refrigerator and allow to sit for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.In a large skillet set over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter and the olive oil. Add the shrimp and arrange into an even layer. Cook until barely pink on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until shrimp are pink on the other side and no longer translucent in the middle, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the shrimp to a plate and set aside.

  
If the pan looks dry, add another tablespoon olive oil. Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until soft and fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil. Let the simmer for 1 minute; add the rest of the butter and swirl and stir the pan until the butter melts. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice and parsley. Return the shrimp to the pan and toss until shrimp are hot and coated in sauce.  
Serve hot, over pasta or with crusty bread for soaking up the sauce."

**Ingredients:**

*For the Meatballs:*

* 1/3 cup Italian breadcrumbs
* 1/3 cup milk
* 1 egg
* 1 lb ground protein (I use 50/50 ground beef and ground pork, but you could use any combination of beef, pork, turkey, chicken, Beyond Meat, etc.)
* 1/3 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese
* 2 cloves of garlic, grated or minced
* 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley

*For the Sauce:*

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 3 cloves of garlic, chopped
* 2 pints of cherry tomatoes, 6 Roma tomatoes OR two 15oz cans of crushed tomatoes (I used cherry because they're in abundance and the skins are non-distinguishable once blended)
* Salt and pepper to taste

*For the Pasta:*

* 1 package of Anellini Siciliani pasta
* Parmesan and chopped parsley to garnish  


**Insrtuctions:**  
*Make the Meatballs:*

1. Start by placing the breadcrumbs, milk, and egg into a large bowl and mix until combined. Add in the ground meat, garlic, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper and mix until uniformly combined.
2. Shape the mixture into small, 1/2-inch balls and set aside in the refrigerator to firm up.  
At this point, you can place a large pot of water over high heat to begin boiling for the pasta.

  
*Make the sauce:*

1. I like to cook the sauce in the drippings from the meatballs, so add a little olive oil to a large pan and cook the meatballs on all sides until browned. This works best on med-high heat while rotating the pan often. Once browned, set the meatballs aside on a plate with a paper towel to draw out excess oil. If there is a lot of oil left over in the pan, just soak some up with a paper towel using tongs.
2. Toss in the onions and cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Then add in the garlic until fragrant, about a minute.
3. Lastly, toss in the tomatoes and cook for 10-15 minutes until softened and thick. Pour into a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.
4. While the tomatoes cook, toss the pasta into the pot of salted boiling water and cook per package instructions (we like our pasta a little al dente, so cook 1-2 minutes less than instructions if you prefer).
5. Add the sauce and meatballs back into the pan at low heat until the pasta is ready.
6. Once the pasta is cooked, pour them into the sauce with the meatballs, adding a little pasta water if you need to loosen the sauce a little.
7. Place in a bowl to serve as is, or top with a little grated parmesan cheese and parsley--enjoy!"

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Immersion blender
* Fine mesh sieve

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and quartered
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and crushed
* 1- inch piece of ginger peeled and roughly chopped
* 1 pound beets peeled and roughly diced; or small-diced if you don’t want to blend them later
* 6 cups water or stock
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon dashi granules optional
* 1 tablespoon mirin
* 16 ounces udon fresh frozen, or dried or use soba, ramen, somen, or your favorite soup noodle.
* Minced scallions or microgreens for serving
* 4 soft-boiled eggs optional for serving

### Instructions

#### Prepare the broth aromatics:

* Heat neutral oil and sesame oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Cook the beets:

* Add the chopped beets and cook 3–4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

#### Simmer the broth:

#### Blend the beets (optional):

* Use an immersion blender to blend until mostly smooth. You can skip this, but I like to get out as much beet flavor as possible. You can also blend until completely smooth and skip the straining step below.

#### Strain the broth (optional):

* Place a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and pour the broth through the sieve. Discard solids and rinse out the sieve (you’ll need it for the noodles). Keep warm.

#### Cook the eggs and noodles:

* Wipe out the pot used to make the beet broth and fill it with water. Bring to a boil. Add the eggs and boil for 7 minutes. Use a ladle to remove them and transfer to an ice bath. Keep the water boiling.
* Add the noodles to the water and cook according to package instructions. Drain and set divide between 4 bowls.

#### To serve:

* Pour the warm beet broth over each bowl of noodles. Peel the eggs and cut in half and place on each bowl. Garnish with scallions or microgreens and a sprinkle of salt. Enjoy!

* 1 cup white rice, thoroughly rinsed
* For serving:
* Sour cream
* Minced red onion
* Lime wedges

* Sliced radishes

**Prepare the scallions:**

1. Slice 2 scallions into thirds; these will simmer with the beans. Mince the remaining four scallions and set them aside.

**Prepare the beans (if using dry beans):**

1. Place the beans, two sliced scallions, and the shallot in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour until mostly tender. Once tender, pluck out and discard the big pieces of scallion. No need to fuss over the shallot pieces; they can cook in the soup. Drain the beans and set aside.

**Prepare the chicken and broth:**

2. Using tongs, carefully remove the bird and transfer it to a large bowl. Let cool.
3. Turn the heat on the broth in the pot to a rapid simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes or until it reduces to about 8 cups of broth. It will darken in color as it cooks down. Adjust the heat as needed if it reduces too quickly.
4. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids.
5. Carefully wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.
6. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Reserve or freeze the carcass for stock later if you like.

**Prepare the soup:**

1. Heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in the pot. Add the diced poblano peppers and diced onion. Sauté for 8-10 minutes. Add the remaining 4 minced scallions, and drained beans. Season generously with chili powder, ancho chili powder, paprika, cumin, and cayenne. Add a sprinkle of salt.
2. Pour in reserved broth and shredded chicken and bring to a boil.

**Simmer the soup:**

2. Add garlic and bell pepper. Continue cooking until garlic is fragrant but not scorched.
3. Increase heat to high. Add beef and pork and cook, breaking apart the meat with a wooden spoon until mostly browned. Approximately 10 minutes.
4. Add wine and deglaze. Boil off the wine until it is mostly evaporated, 3-4 minutes at least.
5. Stir in tomatoes with all liquid if using canned. Reheat to boiling and then reduce heat to medium-low.
6. Add ketchup and tomato paste 
7. Season with more salt and select italian herbs to your liking. 
8. Simmer the now mostly completed sauce, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes or until the sauce has thickened sufficiently.

4. Remove from heat. Allow to slightly cool and then pour in the heated milk in one swift motion. Immediately and quickly blend the mixture together with whisk.
5. Return saucepan to the stove over medium-high heat and continue stirring quickly until the sauce comes to boil.
6. Boil for about 1 minute, while stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat and cling to the back of a spoon.
7. Remove from heat and season slightly with kosher salt and white pepper. Careful not to over-season as to avoid overpowering the dish.
8. If sauce is too thin, boil it down while stirring continually until reduced and thickened. If sauce is too thick, simmer and thin out with milk added in a tablespoon at a time. If sauce is lumpy, either strain or blend it and then simmer for a few minutes.

This miso meatball ramen is creamy, rich ramen made with yuzu miso meatballs and finished with plenty of shichimi togarashi.

Cook Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

Inactive Time: 30 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 45 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 810kcal

## Equipment

* Food processor
* Large, oven-safe casserole dish
* 2 Large pots
* Colander or strainer

## Ingredients

## Turkey meatballs:

* 1 tablespoon dashi granules omit if you don’t have it\*
* 2 cups water
* 4 scallions trimmed
* 2 shallots peeled and quartered
* 2–3 Thai chili peppers or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 tablespoon yuzu miso
* 2 tablespoons shoyu or low-sodium soy sauce
* ¼ cup water
* 1 pound ground turkey
* 1 teaspoon shichimi togarashi
* 2 eggs
* ⅔ cup panko more as needed
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil for frying
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Ramen broth:

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into half-moons
* 8 ounces mushrooms torn or sliced depending on the variety
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons mirin
* 1 tablespoon dashi granules omit if you can’t find it
* ½ cup tahini
* 2 tablespoons chili oil
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoon sesame oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For serving:

* 16 ounces ramen noodles
* 4 eggs
* Shichimi togarashi
* Sliced scallions

## Instructions

## Preheat oven to 275ºF.

## Prepare the dashi braising broth:

* In a large oven-safe casserole dish, combine the 2 cups of water and the dashi granules. If you cannot find dashi, use chicken stock here instead. Set aside.

## Prepare the meatballs:

* Combine the scallions, shallot, Thai chili peppers, miso, shoyu, and water in a food processor. Blend until paste forms.
* Place the turkey in a bowl along with the shichimi togarashi, eggs, panko, and the miso paste mixture from the food processor. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands, being careful not to overmix! Add more panko if the mixture is too loose.
* Take a teaspoon of the mixture and cook in a hot skillet or microwave to taste seasoning. Adjust the seasonings as necessary.

## Fry the meatballs:

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the first batch of meatballs in an even layer, turning every 2–3 minutes until golden brown all over and mostly cooked through. Transfer to the casserole dish with the dashi stock. Continue frying the meatballs in layers until all meatballs have been fried.
* Transfer the casserole dish to the preheated oven as you prepare the rest of the ramen base. *Note: Don't worry if the meatballs don't cook all the way through in the oven; you'll boil them in the ramen broth at the end to fully complete the cooking process!*

## Prepare the ramen broth:

* Wipe out the pot used to fry the meatballs. Heat the 1 tablespoon neutral oil over medium-high and add the sliced onions. Cook for 5 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes until they turn golden brown all over—season with salt and pepper.
* Pour in the chicken stock and add the mirin and dashi granules if you have them. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.

## Finish the meatballs:

* Remove the meatballs from the oven and check the temperature. If they haven’t reached 165ºF yet, add them to the broth and bring them to a boil. Cook in the broth for 7–10 minutes or until the internal temperature of the meatball reaches 165ºF. Once the meatballs are cooked through, reduce the heat on the broth to low.

## Cook the noodles and eggs:

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 4 eggs to water and cook for 8 minutes. Remove from the boiling and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes before peeling the eggs and cutting them half.
* Add the noodles to the same water used for the eggs and boil according to package instructions. Drain, rinse and divide between 4 bowls.

## Prepare the tahini:

* Scoop out two ladles of the hot broth and transfer to a large bowl or glass measuring cup. Mix with the tahini and whisk until completely emulsified. Add the chili oil, soy sauce, and sesame oil and stir to combine. Add back to the pot of meatballs, stirring continuously until incorporated—taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

## To serve:

* Place two egg halves on top of each bowl of noodles. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and add a few meatballs to each bowl. Sprinkle a bit of salt on top of each egg. Finally, sprinkle shichimi togarashi on each bowl and garnish with sliced scallions. Enjoy!

## Notes

Note: If you cannot find dashi granules, replace them with chicken stock for the meatball braising liquid. Omit for the ramen broth.

1. Pour the sugar, cornstarch, and salt into a medium sauce pot and whisk together
2. Pour the milk and egg yolks into a bowl and whisk until all combined
3. Add this liquid mixture to the sauce pot slowly and whisk together
4. Put in chunks of the cubed butter into the sauce pot
5. Turn on to medium heat and bring to a boil all the while whisking (it's important to keep whisking the mixture as it firms up so none of it sticks to the bottom of the sauce pot)
6. Whisking while the mixture is boiling for 1 minute before removing from heat and then mix in the ube extract
7. Transfer the pastry cream to a separate container (**optional**: first strain it through a mesh sieve to ensure the cream has a really smooth consistency)
8. Cover the pastry cream with plastic wrap, ensuring that the plastic wrap touches the top of the pastry cream to discourage the formation of a skin on top of it
9. Place in refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours before using

**Ube Craqueline**

1. Soften the butter and ensure it is nice and fluffy
2. Mix in the ube extract into the softened butter mixture
3. Add in the all purpose flour, brown sugar, and salt into the butter and mix together until thoroughly combined
4. Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and flatten until the dough reaches about 1/4 inch thickness
5. Freeze the dough until ready for use

**Choux Pastry**

1. Pour the water, sugar, salt, and butter into a sauce pot and heat over medium heat
2. Stir the mixture together until the water is boiling and the butter is melted
3. Remove the sauce pot from the stove at this point and dump in all the flour in one go
4. Vigorously mix the flour into the butter/water mixture so that all the water is absorbed
5. Once the dough is formed, return the sauce pot to heat and continue to mix and cook down the dough until it pulls away from the sides of the pot and you're able to stick a spoon into it and have it stand straight up (about 2-5 minutes)
6. Transfer the dough to a bowl and let it cool down for a couple minutes
7. Crack in the eggs one at a time, ensuring the previous egg is fully incorporated into the dough before adding in the next egg
8. Transfer the dough into a piping bag (or a ziplock bag with a small hole cut at the corner)

**Assembly**

1. Preheat the oven to 375F and line a baking tray with parchment paper
2. Remove the craqueline topping from the freezer and cut out disks of a desired size (about 2 inches in diameter or larger) to put on top of the choux pastry
3. Pipe out mounds of choux pastry onto the prepared baking tray and top each mound with a craqueline disk
4. (**optional**: spray the baking tray with water to help encourage the choux to puff up properly)
5. Bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes depending on the size of the choux mounds
6. **DO NOT** open the oven for the first 25 minutes of the baking process of the steam will release and the choux won't puff up properly
7. After about 25 minutes, open the oven and prick each choux with a toothpick and then return to the oven to cook for another 5-10 minutes depending on the choux size (this helps to dry out the insides to maintain a firm choux)
8. Remove from oven once the choux is nice and golden brown and prick each choux again with a toothpick to allow them to dry out even further while they rest
9. Remove the pastry cream from the fridge and line a piping bag (or ziplock bag) with it
10. Cut a little hole from the bottom of each choux pastry and fill the cream puffs with the ube pastry cream

#Ingredients for Creamy Garlic Chicken with Mushrooms and Noodles

16 ounces wide egg noodles

1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

1 cup heavy cream

2 tablespoons sour cream

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

2 teaspoons whole grain mustard

Salt and pepper to taste

4 bonless skinless chicken breasts

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

8 ounces mushrooms (I used baby bella and shiitake)

4 cloves garlic

1 shallot

1 cup chicken stock

¼ cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley

2 tablespoons fresh chives

#Method

Cook the Noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the egg noodles and cook until al dente. Drain and rinse and transfer to a bowl. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil and toss to coat.

Prepare the Cream Base: In a bowl, combine the heavy cream, sour cream, mustards, and salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Chill until ready to use.

Prepare Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Wipe the dirt from the baby bella mushrooms and slice into thick slices. Remove the stems from the shiitake mushrooms and discard. Slice the caps. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Peel and slice the shallot into thin rounds. Mince the parsley leaves and the chives and keep together in a bowl.

Prepare the Chicken: In an oven-safe skillet, heat the 2 tablespoons vegetable oil on medium-high until very hot. Add the chicken and cook for 3-5 minutes per side until very well-browned. Transfer to the oven and bake until an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF, about 8-10 minutes longer. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and transfer back to the stove. Transfer the chicken breasts to a plate.

Cook the Mushrooms: Turn the heat on the skillet back to medium-high and add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 8-10 minutes until well browned. Add the shallot and garlic and cook an additional 2-3 minutes until softened and fragrant.

Prepare the Sauce: Add the chicken stock to the skillet and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Bring to a boil and cook for 5-6 minutes until reduced slightly. Add the cream base and whisk to incorporate. Add all but a pinch of the fresh herbs and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken.

Finish the Dish: After the sauce has simmered, add the noodles and toss to coat and cook for 1-2 minutes more to warm the noodles back up.

To Serve: Slice the chicken breasts on an angle and divide the noodles and mushrooms between bowls. Arrange the sliced chicken on top of the noodles and serve with the reserved herbs. Enjoy!"

For those who don't know of hojicha its essentially the superior brother of matcha (its actually the roasted form of matcha but I like it so much better than the latter). It's got a really amazing roasty toasty aroma and flavor profile to it, and it can easily replace matcha in anything!

Ingredients

Fresh morel mushrooms

2 -3 finely diced ramp leaves (or cloves of garlic)

1 cup of heavy cream

1/4 cup white wine

Salt and pepper

1/2 stick of butter

1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan (plus more for finishing)

Instructions

1. Clean and slice the morels into pinky sized pieces.
2. Bring a skillet to medium heat and melt the butter.
3. Sauté the mushrooms for a few minutes and add the diced ramp leaves. Sauté for another minute.
4. Add the wine and bring up to a simmer so it starts to render down.
5. Continue stirring the mushrooms and slowly add in the heavy cream. Continue stirring and bring back to a simmer.
6. Simmer for another 5 minutes or so, and add more cream (or water) to adjust if necessary.
7. Add the freshly grated parmesan cheese and continue stirring. The sauce should be thickening, creamy, and will start to smell incredible. Season with salt and black pepper after tasting. The parmesan cheese is already quite salty and you don’t want to over salt.
8. The mushrooms should be tender, and completely cooked down. The total time should take about 20 minutes.
9. Transfer your cooked pasta directly into the pan with the cream sauce. Using tongs, roll the pasta around so the sauce complete coats all of the noodles.
10. Garnish each plate with some more freshly ground black pepper and parmesan cheese.

This spicy chicken tortilla soup benefits from a rich, homemade chicken stock. Best of all, this soup feeds a crowd and it comes together in about an hour. While the stock cooks, you can use that time to prep all the ingredients for the soup!

### Grade:

Serves: 6-8

Cost: $3.74 per serving

Skill Level: Easy-Intermediate

Time to Make: About 1 hour 15 minutes (15 minutes inactive)

### Ingredients Spicy Chicken Tortilla Soup

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (You can also use bone-in, skin-on breasts)

6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs

1 bunch cilantro, rinsed

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

2 jalapeño peppers, trimmed and minced

2 bell peppers, trimmed, deseeded, and diced

4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

2 pound fresh Roma tomatoes (or 1 28-ounce can crushed, fire-roasted tomatoes)

1 can black beans, drained and rinsed

2 teaspoons cumin

2 teaspoons chili powder

2 teaspoons paprika

Salt and pepper to taste

**For Serving:**

Crushed tortilla chips

Sliced avocado

Cilantro leaves

### Method

###### Prepare the Chicken Stock:

Place the chicken breasts, chicken thighs, and the cilantro in a large soup pot. Fill the pot up until the chicken is just covered. Season liberally with salt and pepper.

Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to just above a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 30-40 minutes or until the chicken is completely cooked through. As the chicken cooks, skim off any scum from the top of the pot.

Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a bowl. Drain the stock through a fine mesh sieve and discard solids. Reserve 4 cups of the stock and discard or save any remaining stock for another use. Wipe out the stock pot and return it to the stove.

Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and discard. Pick the meat from the bones and tear into bite sized pieces. Discard the bones. Set the chicken meat aside.

###### Blanch the Tomatoes (if using ripe tomatoes, otherwise, skip this step):

Cover the tomatoes with water in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Once the skins begin to burst, transfer to an ice bath. Once they are cool enough to handle, remove the skins and cores and discard. Drain off the ice water and crushed the tomatoes with your hands. Set aside.

###### Cook the Aromatics:

Heat the neutral cooking oil in the soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes until softened.

Add the jalapeño peppers and the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.

###### Deglaze the Pot:

Add 1 cup of the homemade chicken stock to the pot and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the pot.

Pour in the remaining chicken stock along with the crushed tomatoes.

###### Finish the Chicken Tortilla Soup:

Add the drained black beans and cooked chicken along with the cumin, chili powder, and paprika. Season again with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Taste and season again before serving. Turn off the heat.

###### To Serve:

Divide the soup between bowls and garnish with avocado, cilantro, and crushed tortilla chips. Enjoy!"

* Pinch of salt
* To serve: 80-100g pasta per person (I used Fusilli Bucati Corti - long shapes such as Spaghetti, Linguini, Bucatini, etc. work well too)

**Instructions**

* Blend the sunflower seeds (if using), basil, garlic and a pinch of salt in a food processor until broken down into small chunks.
* Add in the cheese and olive oil. Start with 1/4 cup of oil and blend - if it's too thick, add more sparingly bit by bit and blend until it reaches desired consistency.
* This pesto can be eaten on toast, omelettes, protein or potatoes - to serve with pasta: cook pasta in heavily salted water according to package instructions until al dente, reserve 1/4-1/2 cup pasta cooking water and drain. Add pesto (around 1.5-2 tbsp per person) to the pasta with a ladleful of the pasta cooking water and mix through until well coated, adding more pasta cooking water if needed.
* Serve topped with a drizzle of olive oil, fresh basil leaves and grated parmesan or pecorino.

**Notes**

* You don't have to use both Pecorino and Parmigiano, you can just use 4 tbsp of either one.
* The pesto recipe makes 4 servings - any leftovers can be refrigerated for a few days or frozen for up to three months in an airtight container.

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kk3aht,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kk3aht,reddit,"The ""cozonac"" is found everywhere in Romania - it's made every time we're celebrating something important, such as Christmas.

The ones I made here are filled with a walnut and cocoa paste, flavored with vanilla and rum essence. Other varieties exist, such as the very popular turkish delight cozonac.

It's a difficult dough to knead by hand because it requires lots of effort and strong arms. I'd rather not attempt it without a stand mixer but that is up to you. The short story is: you want to knead it until you're able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn't break.

Here is a video version of the recipe, which should help especially when it comes to rolling the cozonac. It's in Romanian but I translated the steps.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6HlVP5LV0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6HlVP5LV0)

Ingredients for two small or a single large cozonac:

*For the dough:*

* 500 to 550 grams of flour (I used ""000"" flour which I think is equivalent to ""pastry flour"")
* 250ml milk
* 8 egg yolks (size M)
* 100g powdered sugar
* 25g granulated sugar
* 25g fresh yeast (or the equivalent dry yeast, as indicated on the package)
* 100g butter
* 25ml oil with neutral taste (such as refined sunflower oil - note that unrefined sunflower oil does carry taste and smell)
* 1 tbsp rum essence
* 1 tbsp vanilla essence
* the zest of a lemon, a similarly sized orange or a combination of the two
* a good pinch of salt

*For the walnut filling:*

* 350g crushed walnuts, I like them very finely crushed but you can leave some chunks in if you want
* 100ml milk
* 200g granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp cocoa powder (I used dark cocoa powder)
* 1 tbsp rum essence
* 1 tbsp vanilla essence
* 2 egg whites (size M)

You'll need some oil, a yolk or two and some milk for finishing as well.

Steps (dough):

1. Place 50g of the flour in a bowl, and get 100ml of milk boiling. Once boiling, pour it over the flour and mix well. Take 25g of yeast and 25g of granulated sugar and beat them together until you get a liquid. You can do this in the same bowl if you're sure the yeast won't touch the hot flour paste. Wait until the flour paste has cooled down and then combine the two together, spread some flour on top, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size. This will be our ""scalded starter mix"".
2. Once that's done, place the remaining flour in your stand mixer's bowl, together with the lemon/orange zest. Mix on the lowest speed, just to combine.
3. Beat the egg yolks with a good pinch of salt, the oil, the rum and vanilla essences and then mix with 150ml of lukewarm or room temperature milk.
4. Add the liquid mixture obtained above to the stand mixer bowl, together with the scalded starter mix that should've risen by now. Turn on the stand mixer on low at first, and gradually increase the speed to a medium-high, until all ingredients are completely combined.
5. Keep mixing, add the powdered sugar, half of it at a time.
6. Once the powdered sugar has been added, continue mixing on a high speed for another 10 minutes.
7. You may need, every now and then, to stop the mixer and scrape the dough from the bowl and the attachment. This dough is very very sticky. At the end we'll cover our table in oil and the thing will most likely still stick to it in some places.
8. After 10 minutes it's time to add the butter, in small chunks. Don't add the next chunk until the previous is completely incorporated.
9. Once the butter has been completely incorporated, keep mixing at high speed for another 15 minutes. Unless you've chosen to do it by hand, in which case you'll have to give the dough a real good smashing for 45 whole minutes. You're pretty badass if you chose this route, not gonna lie.
10. Remember the doneness test: you want to knead it until you're able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn't break.

Place the dough in a bowl that's been greased with oil, cover with a towel, and let to rise until doubled in size in a warm place.

Steps (filling):

1. Place the crushed walnuts in a bowl.
2. Bring 100ml of milk and 200g granulated sugar to a boil, mixing continuously to dissolve the sugar properly.
3. Pour the hot milk & sugar mixture onto the walnuts and mix well.
4. Add the cocoa powder, vanilla and rum essences, the two egg whites, and mix again. Some people choose to beat the egg whites first, I added them as they came out of the egg. Works either way.

Final steps (refer to the video I linked above to best get these steps right):

1. The dough should've risen by now. Spread some oil on your working surface, take the dough out of the bowl and spread it into a rectangular shape that's fairly thin. You can do this by hand because the dough is extremely easy to shape.
2. If you want to make two portions, cut the rectangle in two. Once rolled, the dough should fit in your rectangular loaf tins so keep this in mind.
3. Cover the dough with the walnut filling, leaving out a couple of centimeters around the filling to help with the rolling.
4. Roll from top to bottom, constantly bringing the sides of the rectangle towards the inside.
5. Make sure you've rolled it well and securely sealed it.
6. Place a baking sheet in your pan, making sure to cover the sides properly, then very carefully place the rolled up cozonac in it. Careful, it's fragile, so get your fingers underneath it from the get-go.
7. Beat an egg yolk with a tablespoon or two of milk, and carefully brush the surface of the cozonac.
8. Let it sit covered in a warm place for 45 mins or so, or until it increased in size and reached the top of the pan.
9. In the meantime, preheat your oven to 190 degrees celsius.
10. Get the cozonac in the oven, and let it bake for about 10 minutes, at which point you want to cover it with aluminium foil and bake for another 40 minutes.
11. Take out of the oven, let cool down a bit in the tin, then take them out and let cool further on a rack.

Normally you don't cut into them until they're completely cooled, but rules are made to be broken. I like to eat pieces of the crust while it's still hot. Enjoy!"
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xaizih,https://i.redd.it/3s5w1wqpgzm91.jpg,reddit,"**Ingredients**  


* 2 part baked baguettes
* 250 gr minced meat (beef or pork)
* Herbs for meat - to your liking
* 1 tomato
* 1 onion
* 8 slices of cheese
* 8 slices of (smoked) bacon
* Wooden toothpicks

When my mum used to make this, oh man what a party it was.

**Directions**

1. Take a part baked baguette, and cut it in two.
2. Add minced meat. 100gr should be enough for one. You can vary in herbs, beef/pork to your likings. Mum used to buy sausages, cut them open and use  that meat.
3. Add tomato slices.
4. Put top of part baked baguette on top, add onions, (smoked)bacon (katenspek) and cheese. Notice how I put the bacon and cheese in perpendicular directions. Note: I added onions-Bacon-Cheese, but to get crispier onions, do bacon-onions-cheese.
5. Put the whole thing in the oven. I usually go for 200°C (392° F), for about 15 minutes.When you remove it from the oven, cut the thing in 2 and look if the meat in the middle is completely done.

**Word of advice:** these things fill you up pretty darn good and are not the healthiest of things. So make sure you eat healthy the rest of the day hehe.Enjoy my mum's recipe. Hope in this way even after her passing away she keeps inspiring people. :-)"

**Ingredients** **(makes 1 serving)**

* 2 baby bok choy
* 1 green onion
* 2 shiitake mushrooms
* 1 Chinese sausage
* 2 pieces grilled eel
* 1/2 cup white rice (short grain or jasmine are ok)
* 1 cup water
* 1 salted duck egg yolk

**Directions**

1. Prepare all the toppings first. Cut the bok choy into halves. Dice the green onion, slice the shiitake mushrooms and chinese sausage into thin pieces, and cut the eel into whatever formfactor you desire. *As mentioned earlier, you can put anything you like for toppings, but there is a caveat: if you use toppings that shed water as they cook, such as raw meat, you need to reduce the amount of water used to cook the rice. Otherwise, it’ll end up too soggy. How much to compensate? That’s really hard to tell because different meats shed differing amounts of water. Even the same meat from different sources shed different amounts of water. So, if you use spare ribs for example, you’ll need to experiment with how much water to remove from the rice.*
2. Wash the rice under cold water twice and drain all excess water.
3. Put the clay pot over a stove and turn on to medium heat. Despite what you may have heard, it’s possible to make this dish successfully on a gas or electric stove. I’ve succeeded many times on both. If you only have an induction stove though, you’re out of luck…
4. When the inside of the clay pot gets hot, add \~1tsp oil and swirl it around to coat the bottom.
5. Add the rice into the hot clay pot, and then add in 1 cup of cold water. Cover and continue cooking on medium high heat.
6. As soon as the water boils, open the lid and place in all the toppings EXCEPT the bok choy or any other leafy vegetables you choose. Cover and turn the heat to low and let cook for 12-14 minutes. Now comes the secret to the crispy rice at the bottom. If you want a thinner layer, bias the heat a bit lower and if you want a thicker layer, bias the heat higher. My low heat is not going to be the same as your low heat, so you’ll likely have to experiment a bit. For a typical electric stove that has dial indicators from 1 to 8, I’d use a 2. When in doubt, always bias a little lower so that you don’t end up with a burnt mess.
7. While the rice is cooking, in a separate pot, boil some water, add in \~1 tsp oil, and parboil the bok choy for about 1 minute. Then, drain the hot water and shock the bok choy in cold water until its cool to touch. Drain the cold water. The process is the same if you choose to use other leafy greens.
8. Once the 12-14 minutes is up for the rice, remove the lid and check that the rice looks soft but not soggy.
9. Place in the bok choy and put the lid back on. Turn off the flame and let rest for 10 minutes.
10. At the end of the 10 minutes, optionally garnish with green onion. Add in a bit of soy sauce, mix the contents, and enjoy a piping hot clay pot rice."

Ingredients

* 8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks; 225g)
* 1 standard ice cube (about 2 tablespoons; 30mL frozen water)
* 10 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups; 280g)
* 3/4 teaspoon (3g) baking soda
* 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt (4g)
* 5 ounces granulated sugar (about 3/4 cup; 140g)
* 2 large eggs (100g)
* 2 teaspoons (10mL) vanilla extract
* 5 ounces dark brown sugar (about 1/2 tightly packed cup plus 2 tablespoons; 140g)
* 8 ounces (225g) semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped with a knife into 1/2- to 1/4-inch chunks
* Coarse sea salt, for garnish

Directions

1. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a medium bowl, whisk in ice cube, transfer to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes, whisking occasionally. (Alternatively, whisk over an ice bath to hasten the process.)

2. Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Place granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes.

3. Fit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges), add brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in stand mixer. Mix on medium speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until just barely combined, with some dry flour still remaining, about 15 seconds. Add chocolate and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate dough at least overnight and up to 3 days.

4.
When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 325°F. Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop or a spoon, place scoops of cookie dough onto a nonstick or parchment-lined baking sheet. Each ball should measure approximately 3 tablespoons in volume, and you should be able to fit 6 to 8 balls on each sheet. Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface, then stick them back together with the rough sides facing outward. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown around edges but still soft, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through baking.

5.
Remove baking sheets from oven. While cookies are still hot, sprinkle very lightly with coarse salt and gently press salt down to embed. Let cool for 2 minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.

6.
Repeat steps 3 through 5 for remaining cookie dough. Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight container, plastic bag, or cookie jar at room temperature for up to 5 days.

* 1 Bok choy
* 200gr shitake mushrooms
* 200gr bean sprouts (tauge)
* 2 red onions
* ⁠5 spring onions
* ⁠3 garlic cloves
* A few thyme twigs
* Teriyaki sauce
* Noodles
* Fried onions
* Sirloin steak
* Butter
* ⁠Salt
* Pepper
* Chili flakes

\`This was for 2 people.

**Instructions**

1. Cut the red onions and add it to a wok. Fry it in some oil. Then add the shitake mushrooms and add some seasoning (pepper, salt, chili flakes) and fry these together on medium heat until they have a nice color. Put heat on lowest.
2. Cut the garlic cloves. Not too small or they will burn. Season the steak with pepper and salt. Put some oil in a different pan on high heat. Add the steak and sear both sides on high heat for a minute.
3. Then add a generous lump of butter, the garlic and some thyme twigs. Turn down the heat to medium and let the steak fry in the butter/garlic/thyme mixture for another minute or 2. Spoon some butter mixture on top of the steak regularly. You can also tilt your pan forwards so the butter and the steak slide to the far end to infuse the steak with the mixture.
4. Brush some teriyaki sauce on the top and turn the steak to caramelise the brushed-on sauce. Do the same for the other side. Your steak should now be crispy on both sides. Take the steak out of the pan and let rest in aluminium foil. Remove the thyme twigs from the pan.
5. Cut the bok choy and spring onions into small pieces and add to the wok. Add the bean spouts as well. Now add the leftover garlic/butter from the other pan to this pan. Wok on high heat. Add seasoning to taste. Add your noodles. Turn down the heat and add some teriyaki sauce. Keep some sauce for later. Stir thoroughly.
6. Add the noodles/veggies to a plate. Cut the steak in thick slices and put on top op the noodles. Drizzle some sauce and sprinkle some fried onions on top and you're done!"

Note: This is a vegan recipe though you can easily swap the vegan butter for dairy butter if you like!

### Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons vegan butter divided
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms torn or sliced depending on the variety
* 1 stalk green garlic or 8 cloves garlic minced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 ½ cups arborio rice
* 6–7 cups warm water or vegetable stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For serving, optional:

* ½ lemon juiced
* ½ cup loosely packed parsley minced

### Instructions

#### Brown the mushrooms:

* Melt two tablespoons of vegan butter into a wide pot. Once frothy, add the mushrooms and cook until all of the liquid releases and evaporates. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to cook the mushrooms in batches. Depending on the mushroom variety, this will take anywhere from 18–20 minutes.
* Continue cooking until the mushrooms crisp up and take on a deep, golden color. If you cooked the mushrooms in batches, add all of them back to the pot and season with salt and pepper.

#### Cook the garlic:

* Next, add the minced green garlic or garlic cloves to the cooked mushrooms along with the dry thyme and cook until just fragrant.

#### Prepare the risotto:

* Add the arborio rice to the pot of mushrooms and cook until it toasts slightly, about 2 minutes.
* Begin adding the warm liquid in 1-cup increments, agitating the rice, and adding more liquid only after the rice has absorbed all the liquid in the pot. You'll need 5 to 7 cups and about 40 minutes of regular stirring. Turn off the heat once the risotto takes on a creamy texture and the rice is al dente. If using water, season the risotto liberally with salt and pepper. If using vegetable stock, you may not need as much salt.
* Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.
* Let the risotto rest off the heat for five minutes.

#### Finish the risotto:

* Stir the juice from half a lemon into the risotto if you like. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges from the other half of the lemon. Enjoy!

# Ingredients 

* 4 large egg yolks
* ½ cup light brown sugar
* ½ teaspoon Kosher salt
* 4 tablespoons cornstarch 
* 2 cup whole milk
* 2 teaspoon vanilla
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into small pieces
* 1 17.3 ounce box defrosted puff pastry
* 1 cup strawberry jam, warmed
* 1 egg yolk + 1 tablespoon cold water, whisked together 
* Coarse demerara sugar
* Honey (optional)
* Strawberries for decorating

# Instructions

**Step 1**

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, brown sugar, and salt – stir in the cornstarch. In a medium-sized pot, heat the milk over medium heat. Temper the egg mixture by slowly whisking in a small amount of the hot milk.

Slowly whisk the tempered egg mixture into the remaining hot milk. Keep whisking until the mixture thickens for about five minutes. If the cream isn’t thickening, increase the heat a bit. The pastry cream is ready when it’s slightly thicker than pudding. Once thick, remove from heat and stir in both the vanilla and softened butter – whisk out any remaining lumps. Strain the pastry cream into a clean medium-sized bowl using a fine mesh strainer or sieve.

Immediately cover the surface of the pastry cream with plastic wrap. Make sure to press down on the plastic wrap so it’s touching the whole surface of the pastry cream. This prevents skins from forming on the pastry cream. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours.

**Step 2**

After the custard is finished cooling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Counter thaw the puff pastry for about 30 minutes (don’t allow the pastry to get too warm because it will shrink when baking). Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper. Prepare the thawed puff pastry by laying it out flat on a clean cutting board. Cut the puff pastry into 12 evenly sized rectangles. 

Place 6 rectangles on each half sheet pan. Using a sharp knife,  score around the edges of each rectangle of puff pastry – leaving a several centimeter border. Brush each pastry rectangle with the prepared egg wash and generously sprinkle with demerara sugar – focusing on the border.  Bake the pastries in batches for 14 minutes. While the first batch is baking, place the second in the refrigerator to keep the pastry cool.

Remove from the oven, and using a sharp knife carefully cut through the score marks that surround the center rectangle. You want the center of the pastry to collapse while it’s still soft and warm. Transfer each pastry with a depressed center to a wire rack to completely cool. Repeat the process with the second batch. 

**Step 3**

Once cooled, heat the strawberry jam in a small saucepan over low heat. Spoon several tablespoons of warm jam into each pastry divot – allow to cool for 20 minutes.  Slice the strawberries and coat them with honey (optional) – set aside. Using a piping bag with a star tip, pipe the pastry cream in small dots on top of the jam filled divot.  Decorate with the honey covered strawberries. 

 ***Note:*** Assemble as close to serving as possible. Pastry cream will separate when warm."

6. How to make the bear's paw shape: Flatten the dough into an elliptical shape, make sure the dough is as wide as the sausage or you can trim the sausage to an ideal length. Place the sausage in the middle, fold the dough, and make four even cuts on the sausage. Flip/twist the cut to leave the sausage side up.

Notes:  
- This is basically a no knead recipe, there is barely and mixing and kneading involved, which is a plus for me. The gluten forms during the resting phases of the recipe  
- The poking of holes is a necessary step. The green onion flavour just seeps through those holes and becomes one with the bread  
- If possible, Make the green onion oil first and then use the oil for the dough as well, it will taste better and more onion-y

This creamy chicken pasta recipe is a rich, comforting creamy chicken pasta with vegetables like Brussels sprouts and roasted red bell peppers.

This creamy chicken pasta recipe can be made in a few different ways:

* Raw split chicken breasts that you turn into a homemade chicken stock
* Leftover shredded chicken from a homemade or store-bought roasted chicken
* Raw, boneless chicken that you simply chop up and sauté until cooked through before starting the sauce

For the recipe below, I used raw split chicken breasts that I turned into very simple chicken stock. However, this does add more time to the recipe. If you’re in a pinch and you have leftover shredded chicken already, you can skip the steps for making the stock and move right into the sauce preparation.

**What you need:**

For this recipe, you’ll primarily need chicken, pasta, vegetables, and heavy cream. Take a look at some of my substitution suggestions so you can modify this dish any way you like:

* **Chicken:** Omit for vegetarian. You could also use shrimp but you would skip baking the dish to avoid overcooking them.
* **Brussels sprouts:** Use your favorite vegetables in this meal! Try it with zucchini, broccoli or broccolini, cauliflower florets, eggplant, or use spinach.
* **Roasted red bell peppers:** Chopped sun-dried tomatoes

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Baking sheet
* Wide ovenproof pot
* Sieve
* Tongs

### Ingredients

#### Chicken stock (optional):

* 1 pound bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
* 1 yellow onion quartered, paper left on
* 1 head of garlic halved, paper left on
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Creamy chicken pasta:

* 16 ounces pasta of your choice like strozzapreti, rigatoni, penne, rotini, or fusilli
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 2 red bell peppers trimmed, seeded, and quartered
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts halved
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more if desired
* ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
* 1½ cups homemade chicken stock from above or use store-bought stock
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Freshly minced parsley optional, for garnish

### Instructions

#### Prepare the stock:

* Cover split chicken breasts with water and season liberally with salt. Add the quartered onion and halved head of garlic. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30–40 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Skim off the foam that floats to the top as the chicken cooks.
* Use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Bring the stock back to a boil and boil for 15 minutes until significantly reduced. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl and set aside. You will need 1½ cups stock for the recipe, and any extra stock can be saved for another use.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with your fingers, two forks, or dice it up. Discard the skin and bones.
* Wipe out the pot used for the stock and fill it back up with salted water and return it to the stovetop. You'll use it for the pasta later on.

#### Broil the red bell peppers:

* While the stock cooks, prepare the red bell peppers. Arrange the prepared peppers on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Place under a broiler and cook for 7–8 minutes until blackened all over. Keep an eye on them, so they don't burn to a crisp!
* Immediately transfer the peppers to a Tupperware dish with a lid or a gallon freezer bag. The trapped steam will help the skins come off easily. Peel the peppers and roughly chop and set aside.
* Turn the broiler off and turn the oven's heat to 400ºF.

#### Cook the pasta:

* Bring the pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until 2 minutes under al dente. Drain and set aside.

#### Cook the vegetables:

* In a wide, oven-proof pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook the onion until softened–about 7–10 minutes–and then turn the heat to high. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 6 minutes until well-charred. Add the chopped red peppers and cook for 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Once bubbly, add dry thyme and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add flour to the butter and cook for 2–3 minutes until lightly golden. Slowly whisk in the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and then reduce heat and continue whisking until completely smooth.
* Stir in the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and more crushed red pepper if you like. Turn off the heat.

#### Bake the pasta:

* To the sauce, add the cooked chicken, cooked pasta, and the reserved vegetables and toss to coat and evenly distribute the ingredients. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and transfer to the oven for 10–15 minutes or until the Brussels sprouts are fork-tender and the cheese is melted. If you like, broil for 2–3 minutes to char the top of the pasta.

#### To serve:

* Garnish the pasta with fresh minced parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy!

 **Ingredients for the starter:**

* 500ml (0.52 quart) bottled or boiled water in room temperature (no chlorine)
* 6tbsp rye flour (you can use wholemeal wheat flour as well)
* 5 garlic cloves, peeled
* 4 bay leaves
* 10 allspice berries

**Ingredients for the soup:**

* 1,5 litre (1.58 quart) of hot chicken or vegetable stock
* 500ml (0.52 quart) of Żurek starter
* 4 pork sausages (unsmoked)
* 250g (8.8oz) uncut smoked bacon (boczek)
* 300g (10.6oz) potatoes diced
* 1 medium carrot small dice
* 1tsp marjoram
* 3 tsp of double cream
* salt and black pepper to taste
* 3 boiled eggs, cut in half

**Method for the starter:**

**1.** For the preparation of starter, you need to use water without chlorine as it kills the microbes that you need to transform ingredients into new flavours.

**2.** Put all the starter ingredients into a clean jar and stir until all combined.

**3.** Cover the jar with a paper towel or a cloth and tie the top (this helps the starter to breathe)

**4.** Place the jar in room temperature away from the direct sunlight, after a couple of days you will smell the aroma of all the spices that ferment, at that point you can cover it with a layer of clingfilm. After around 7 days your starter is ready.

**5.** You can use it straight away or store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks (if you store it in the fridge remove and discard spices from the starter, if you use it straight away you can add it as it is).

 **Method for the soup:**

**1.** Dice bacon and pan-fry on high heat for 4-5 minutes.

**2.** To the hot stock add bacon, carrots, potatoes, and whole sausages, marjoram, bring to boil and simmer for 20 minutes.

**3.** Add Zurek starter bring to boil again and simmer for another 10 minutes.

**4.** Take soup off the heat and remove sausages, slice and place back in the pot.

**5.** Put the cream in the bowl and add a ladle of the soup, mix it together and pour back into the pot (this prevents the cream from curdling).

**6.** Serve Żurek with hard-boiled eggs and fresh [bread](https://www.insightflavour.com/breadrecipes)."

**Ingredients:**

- 3 tbsp olive oil

- 250g bacon (guanciale or pancetta would be better, but I didn’t have any at hand)

- 1 medium red onion, diced

- 3 garlic cloves, minced

- 1 tsp chili flakes

- 1 tsp tomato paste

- 400g canned tomatoes

- 270g bucatini

- Salt and pepper to taste

- A bunch of basil

- A few slices of burrata

**Preparation:**

1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon while the oil is still cold. Cook for 10 minutes, which should render most of the fat out. 

2. Add the onion, sauté for 4 minutes. Add the garlic, chilli flakes and tomato paste, sauté for another minute. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes. Cut off the heat, then add the basil, salt and pepper to taste. 

3. Cook your pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and reserve 4 tbsp of the pasta water.

4. Add the pasta to the sauce in the skillet along with the pasta water you reserved. Mix well to combine and slightly emulsify.

5. Top with the burrata, additional basil and freshly ground black pepper. Serve. 

Sorry if I offended any Italians by adding burrata to this dish, I just had a lot of it in the fridge plus I absolutely love it.

### Notes

If you like a spicier Gumbo replace smoked sausage with andouille sausage, making it 4 Links of Andouille and add another TBSP of Creole Seasoning.

I like to peel about 70% of the shrimp before I put in, this way most won't need peeling while you're eating but you still get the flavor from the shrimp shell from the remaining 30%.

The stock is flexible, you can use all Seafood, or all Chicken - I just like the blend of both.

Enjoy!

# Ingredients

*Serves 4*

* 4 English muffins
* 4 slices of quality ham / bacon / any salty meat
* 4 eggs for poaching
* For the sauce  

   * 2 egg yolks
   * Juice of 1/4 lemon (\~1.5 tablespoons)
   * a pinch salt
   * 2 tablespoons water
   * 3/4 stick of butter
   * 1/4 teaspoon of minced shallot (optional)
   * a pinch of white pepper (optional)

# Method

1. Bring a shallow pot of salted water to a simmer
2. Crack your eggs into a fine mesh strainer. Swirl around to drain off the runny portion of the egg white and drop into the simmering water.
3. Mix water occasionally. Lift eggs with a slotted spoon and poke to check doneness. Eggs are ready once white is completely set and the yolk portion feels gooey - about 2 minutes. Place cooked eggs on paper towel to let dry.
4. To make hollandaise:   

   1. Heat butter until completely melted. Yes, you can use a microwave.
   2. Add all other ingredients to a blender. Pulse briefly to mix.
   3. Drip in your butter *slowly*. If your blender has an opening in the cover, it is best to do this while the blades are spinning. Otherwise, just carefully pour and blend incrementally. You can also use a hand blender for this. Add water/lemon juice to adjust consistency/acidity. Season to taste.
5. Toast English muffin
6. Heat up ham
7. **Assemble**. Stack ham on english muffin, egg on ham, and sauce on egg. Or… eff it. Stack it in whatever configuration you like. It’s 2019. 
8. My favorite way to serve these is family-style on a big, nice-lookin’ tray or cutting board. This way, when you place the benny on the table, it will send a shock-wave of pure excitement and impressiveness that will ignite the spirits of everyone sitting there and awaiting their meal. Then, you can sit back and enjoy watching them frantically grab and fight for the little towers of decadence. Beautiful.
9. Make sure to grab one for yourself before the carnage ensues. Eat and **enjoy**."

*For the brownie*

• 250g softened butter

•100g white sugar, 50g brown sugar

• 3 eggs

• 150g ground almond

• 50g flour

• 100g baking cocoa

• optional: chopped brittle 


*For the topping*

• 200ml heavy cream

• 250g mascarpone

• Vanille sugar and regular sugar to taste

• 1 tbsp. lemon juice

• Whatever berries and how much you like, I used strawberries, raspberries and blueberries 


**Steps**

1. Pre-heat oven to 175 C, prepare springform by greasing up with softened butter or use baking foil

2. Brownie: Mix butter and  sugar up in a bowl until the mixture is almost white

3. Add eggs one by one and keep mixing

4. Combine flour, baking cocoa and almond in a bowl. Add to the egg butter mixture and optionally hazelnut brittles, mix until homogeneous mass.

5. Pour mixture into springform, even out and put in oven for 30 minutes.

6. Get cake out of the oven, let cool. Maybe cut into a heart shape if you feel dandy like I did.

7. whisk up heavy cream.

8. In a separate bowl, stir up mascarpone, lemon juice and sugar. I added some raspberry for color too.

9. carefully add heavy cream to the mascarpone mixture.

10. Decorate cake with the cream and berries.


EDIT:  We actually had the cake as desert way later after I posted the picture, so there’s a step I left out in the description because I was worried it might be too sweet and didn’t want anyone who recreates it make that possible mistake. After eating one bite I knew that extra step was a good decision, rounds it up nicely: put a layer of strawberry jam (or probably any jam you think goes well with the cake) between the brownie and the topping, so right before you spread the cream on."

[Original Recipe](https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/how-to-make-focaccia)

**Dough Ingredients**

* 9 g Instant Yeast
* 335 g Water (105-115 F)
* 450 g Flour (Bread or All purpose)
* 9 g Salt
* 9 g Extra Virgin Olive Oil

**For Baking:**

* 20 g Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* 20 g Water

**Topping Ideas:**

* Coarse Kosher Salt
* Fresh Rosemary
* Garlic
* Chiles

**Method:**

**1 -** **Mix the ingredients**

* Add the yeast to the warm water along with a spoonful of the flour. Stir until dissolved. Let stand for 5-10 minutes until a light foam surfaces and little bubbles are visible. **Note:** Proofing is done to test the viability of the yeast. If there is no foam surface or little bubbles the yeast is likely dead and should be discarded for new yeast.
* Meanwhile, add the flour, and salt to a large mixing bowl. Once the yeast is proofed, pour in the mixture and mix the dough with your hands until no dry flour remains in the bowl and a cohesive mass forms. The dough will be very sticky. Pour the olive oil over the dough, work together until the oil is absorbed. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.

**2 -** **Bulk Fermentation + Gluten Development**

* Once rested, perform a stretch and fold by grabbing a corner of the dough in the bowl, lift straight up to stretch the dough as high as it will go without tearing and fold over to the other side. Rotate the bowl and perform three more reps of stretch and folds. Once folded, turn the dough over onto itself, cover, and let rest another 25-30 minutes. This is one set of a stretch and fold, perform 3 more sets with 25-30 minutes rest in between.
* For each stretch and fold set, the dough should feel more elastic and stretch further without tearing with some air bubbles present

**3 - Proofing (Second Ferment)**

* Drizzle olive oil into a 9x13 baking pan until the bottom is covered. After the last stretch and fold, turn the focaccia dough into the pan and gently work it to the edges.
   * **Note: If the dough is springing back from the edges, cover and let rest for 15-20 minutes before gently working to the edges.**
* Cover the pan and let the focaccia proof for 45-60 minutes. At the end of proofing, the dough should be well risen and puffy with gas bubbles. Preheat the oven to 450 F.

**4 - Dimple + Add Toppings**

* Dimple the proofed dough with wet fingers by gently pushing to the bottom of the pan, but do not accidentally go through the dough. For me, I like lots of dimples and run over the dough 2-3 times.
* Whisk the olive oil and water together with a fork until it emulsifies, about 2-3 minutes. Pour the mixture over the focaccia where it will pool into the dimples.
* Sprinkle flaky salt and fresh herbs over the top. If using other toppings like grape tomatoes, or olives, add them now too and gently press into the dough.
   * **Note: This turns into a great pizza with sauce, cheese, and anything else you may have in the fridge.**

**5 - Bake**

* Place on the middle rack of the 450 F oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden on top. Let rest under a cloth on a wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing into hunks of focaccia
* Serve as is, or slice in half for creating sandwiches."

Edit: I'll add directions when I'm not on mobile in a couple hours. Sorry!!

Edit 2: [This is the recipe I followed](https://youtu.be/Ohy1DELF4is)

---

* As with any of stir fry dish, get everything prepped in advance, as it should only take a few minutes of actual cooking

* I doubled the above recipe and cooked in it smaller batches. I really think cooking it this way comes out better as you're able to brown the noodles more effectively, which really adds to their flavor

* Chop up broccoli, garlic and set aside in separate bowls

* I bought sheets of refrigerated rice noodles, and cut them into large pieces about as long as your pinky finger and about an inch wide, side as in a bowl

* Cut up your meat into thin slices, I used flank steak, side aside in yet another bowl, season with some soy sauce

* Prepare the sauce in another bowl

* I prefer to use a non-stock pan instead of a wok, I really think this gets better browning and nothing sticks, and with my crappy stove you get more heat, more browning and you can use less oil

* I also prefer to cook the meat first and remove from the pan to be added at the end, this adds some additional time to the whole process, so up to you, but I feel its easier to prevent overcooking the meat

* Add some oil to the pan, add some garlic as it heats up as high as you can get it

* Before garlic starts to brown, add your broccoli (and meat, if you choose to not cook it ahead of time) and stir fry for a minute or so

* Add noodles to the pan and add just enough of the sauce coat everything, especially the noodles - I don't like to add all the sauce at once, you can always add more if it seems dry (definitely don't add all the sauce if you're cooking in batches like I suggested)

* Sprinkle in some sugar

* Be gentle when pushing the noodles around as they'll break up easily, and let the noodles sit against the pan for 10-20 seconds at a time to allow some browning

* Push everything to the side and add an egg, break the yolk and scramble, mix with the rest of the ingredients in the pan

* (Throw the meat back in if you chose to cook ahead of time and head through)

Done!

- 450g shrimp, deveined and peeled (shells set aside)
- 4 tbsp butter
- 1 yellow onion
- 10 cloves garlic
- 2 tbsp ginger
- 8 cups water/chicken stock
- Salt & pepper

The shrimp shells can be replaced with 1tsp fish sauce if you get pre-shelled shrimp

**Shrimp noodle soup:**

- 450g thin rice noodles
- 3tsp sesame oil
- 1tsp neutral cooking oil (for frying)
- 1 yellow onion
- 250g shiitake mushroom (fresh or dried) caps thinly sliced, stems discarded
- 1 tbsp chilli pepper
- 340g broccoli florets
- Salt & pepper

**Prepare the shrimp stock:**

1. Melt 60g butter into a soup pot over medium heat. Once melted and frothy, add 450g shrimp shells and mash them lightly against the side of the pot. Sauté for 6-8 minutes, stirring frequently.

2. Add 1 peeled and thinly sliced yellow onion, 10 cloves of chopped garlic and 2 tbsp minced ginger

3. Season with salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring occasionally for an additional 5-7 minutes.

4. Add 8 cups of water (or chicken stock) to the pot (add 1tsp fish sauce now if you’re using it) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 25-30 minutes.

5. If your shrimp (450g) aren’t fresh, defrost them now

6. If your shiitake mushrooms (250g) are dried, soak them in water for 20-30 minutes whilst the stock is simmering.

7. After the stock has simmered, turn off the heat and strain into a large bowl through a fine mesh sieve. Discard the solids and set the stock aside, then wipe out the pot and return it to the stove. DON’T wash it, you’ll need it later.

**Prepare the soup:**

8. Peel and thinly slice one yellow onion, then prepare the 340g broccoli and the 250g mushrooms by removing the stems and slicing the caps thinly.

9. In the same pot used to cook the stock, heat 2tsp sesame oil and 1tsp neutral cooking oil over medium heat. Once hot (drop a small piece of onion in to check, if it sizzles then its ready), add the onion and cook for 5-7 minutes until soft and translucent.

10. Add 250g shiitake mushrooms and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the shiitakes begin to turn golden brown.

11. Season with salt, pepper, and chilli pepper to suit your tastes

12. Pour the shrimp stock into the soup and bring it to a boil

13. Add 340g broccoli florets and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until bright green

14. Finally, add the 450g peeled shrimp and cook for 3-4 minutes, until cooked through but not overcooked. 

15. Turn off the heat. Taste and season again to your preferences.

**Cook the noodles:**

16. Bring a large pot of water (not the pot you used to make the stock) to a boil and cook 450g thin rice noodles for 6-8 minutes (or according to the package). Drain, rinse and drizzle with 1tsp sesame oil. Set aside.

**To serve:**

Divide the cooked noodles between bowls and ladle the shrimp and vegetables on top."

**Directions:**

1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk. Mix the salt, sugar, flour, eggs, and milk together in a big bowl. Make sure there is no dry flour left. Cover and rest for 20 min.
2. Add the melted butter. Slap, sketch, and fold the dough to absorb all the melted butter. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm place (80-90°F) for 1 hour or until it expands to twice its original size.
3. Make the garlic butter sauce by mixing room temperature butter and minced garlic.
4. After the dough has grown to twice its original size, remove the air bubbles until the size of the dough is almost the same as before the rise.
5. Divide the dough into four pieces. Each piece can make 4 buns.
6. Flatten the dough with a rolling pin, roll it out to a rectangular shape, brush on the garlic butter sauce evenly. Fold it twice, roll out the dough again, divide it into four pieces.
7. Cut one piece into three strands and make a 3-strand braid. Then pinch the end together and roll it up from the end.

##Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil

* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced

* 1 fennel bulb trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced

* 1 red bell pepper trimmed, seeded, and diced

* 2 tablespoons butter

* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced

* 2 teaspoons dry rosemary

* 2 teaspoons dry thyme

* ¼ cup fresh parsley minced

* 3 scallions white and light green parts, separated

* 1 pound chicken tenderloins or breasts cut into bite-sized cubes

* 1 pound skin-on bone-in chicken thighs

* 8 cups water

* 1 ¼ cup dry orzo

* 1 lemon juiced

* Salt and pepper to taste

* **For serving:**

* Fennel fronds

* Minced parsley

##Instructions

**Cook the aromatics:**

Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and fennel and cook for 6–8 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute—season with salt and pepper.

**Prepare the herbs:**

Place the white parts of the scallions in a food processor along with the rosemary, thyme, and parsley and pulse until minced. Alternatively, mince the scallions and combine with the rosemary, thyme, and parsley in a mortar and pestle and mixed until completely crushed.

**Bloom the herbs:**

Melt the butter into the pot of aromatics. Once bubbly, add the minced scallion whites, rosemary, thyme, and parsley—cook for 1 minute.

**Cook the chicken:**

Add the diced chicken tenderloins and cook for 3 minutes. Place the chicken thighs on top and season everything with salt and pepper.

**Simmer the soup:**

Add the water to the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes. Skim the surface of the soup occasionally to remove any foam or scum that floats to the top—taste and season to your preferences.

**Shred the chicken thighs:**

Remove the chicken thighs from the pot and remove the skin. Shred the meat from the bone and discard the bones and skin. Return the shredded chicken to the pot. Bring the soup back to a boil.

**Cook the orzo:**

Once the soup is boiling, add the orzo. Stir regularly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 10 minutes until al dente.

**Finish the soup:**

Mince the green parts of the scallion and stir them into the soup along with the juice from the lemon—taste and season once more to your preferences.

**To serve:**

Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with fennel fronds and more minced parsley. Enjoy!"

**Salad:**

   * 1 green cabbage, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise (use a mandoline slicer for quicker and better results)
   * 2 (9 oz) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
   * 1 1/2 – 2 cups matchstick carrots, or 2 medium carrots cut into matchsticks
   * 1 red bell pepper, cut into small cubes
   * 2 handfuls of croutons ( optional for paleo)

   * 1 teaspoon poppy seeds, toasted

**Dressing:**

   * 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
   * 1/4 cup olive oil
   * 1/4 cup chopped spring onions, green and white parts
   * A handful of raspberries

**Marinade:**

   * 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce

   * 3 tablespoons olive oil
   * Juice of one lime
   * 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
   * 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
   * 1 teaspoon Sriracha
   * 2 – 3 cloves garlic, minced
   * 1 tablespoon honey

***
**Directions**

**For the marinade:**

1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together soy sauce, ginger, olive oil, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, Sriracha, minced garlic and honey.

2. Add chicken breasts to a large resealable bag and add 3 to 4 tablespoons of the marinade mixture, reserving the remaining. Seal the bag and rub the marinade over chicken, then transfer chicken to your refrigerator and let rest at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 day.

**For the dressing:**

1. Add balsamic vinegar, olive oil, raspberries to a blender and pulse to emulsify the vinaigrette. Add 1/4 cup chopped green onions and whisk to combine. Set aside in the refrigerator.

**For the salad:**

1. Heat a grill or grill pan over the stove top over medium-high heat. Brush grill lightly with canola or vegetable oil, then place marinated chicken on the grill and cook, about 4 minutes per side, or until chicken has cooked through.

2. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Then, cut chicken breasts crosswise into 1/4-inch strips.

**To assemble the salad:**

1. In a large bowl toss together cabbage, chicken, carrots, spring onions, bell pepper croutons and cilantro with enough raspberry dressing to coat the salad. Add chicken strips, drizzle with additional raspberry vinaigrette and sprinkle with poppy seeds.

**Notes:** The chicken is flavorful but not very spicy without a good drizzle of the marinade glaze. Reduce the remaining of the marinade in a saucepan. You can then customize the heat of the chicken by adding more or less glaze at the end of grilling.

# Cherry Jalapeño Spread

**Ingredients:**

* 8 oz whipped cream cheese
* 1 cup fresh cherries, washed and pitted
* 1 large jalapeño (or two small)
* 2 tbsp white vinegar
* 2 tbsp + 1 tsp sugar, divided
* ½ tsp salt
* 2 tbsp water

**Instructions:**

1. In a small bowl combine the vinegar, salt, water, and 1 tsp sugar. Seed the jalapeño then thinly slice it. Add the jalapeño to the bowl and let soak for at least 10 minutes before using.
2. Puree the cherries in a small blender or food processor until liquefied but slightly chunky.  Measure out ¼ cup of the mixture and add to a medium mixing bowl. Reserve remaining mixture. (You could attempt this step chopping by hand but don’t lose the juice)
3. After the jalapeño has soaked for at least 10 minutes, remove it from the liquid and mince until it becomes a paste. Measure out 2 tsp of the jalapeño and add it to the mixing bowl with the cherries, reserve any remaining jalapeño.
4. Add the cream cheese and 2 tbsp of sugar to the bowl with the cherries and jalapeño and mix well. Taste the mix and add additional cherry or jalapeño to your liking.

# Ingredients

* 8 oz dry rigatoni
* 2 tablespoon unsalted butter (use 1 tablespoon at a time)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 2 tablespoon gochujang
* 1 cup heavy cream
* ½ cup pasta water
* ¼ cup parmesan (extra for topping)
* 2 chives (chopped)

# Instructions

1. Boil pot of water and salt generously. The general rule of thumb is 1 tablespoon of salt for 1 lb of pasta. Since we are using ½ lb of pasta, salt water with ½ tablespoon of salt. Cook rigatoni according to package instructions.
2. In a pan, melt 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter on low-medium heat and add minced garlic. Lightly sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add gochujang and cook down for about a minute to release the paste's flavors. Next, add heavy cream and gently stir until gochujang is evenly distributed throughout and cream becomes a rose-pink color.
4. Drain pasta and reserve ½ cup of the pasta water. Add reserved pasta water into the creamy gochujang sauce and bring the sauce back to a gentle simmer.
5. Add cooked pasta into sauce and mix until pasta is evenly coated. Simmer at low heat for about 2-3 minutes.
6. Finish off with parmesan and the last 1 tablespoon of butter to keep sauce shiny and glossy. Stir gently until butter has melted.

**Ingredients**

Pie Crust

* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar or to taste
* 1 cup butter cold, cut into 1/2"" cubes
* 6-10 tbsp water ice cold

Berry Filling

* 5 cups berries I used strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* 2 tbsp butter cut into small pieces

Instructions

Pie Crust

* Add the flour, salt, and sugar to your food processor. Pulse a few times to blend everything together. Add the butter and continue to pulse until the cubes turn into pea-sized pieces. Drizzle 6 tbsp of water over the flour and butter mixture in the food processor. Pulse until chunky, coarse, and crumbly.
* Turn the mixture out onto a clean surface. Continue to add water, 1-2 tbsp at a time, until the dough comes together. Split the dough in half and form into 2 disks, wrap them well with plastic wrap, and transfer to the fridge for 2 hours.
* Unwrap one of the disks (leaving the other one in the fridge), and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out, carefully, keeping the circular shape, until it's about 1/8"" thick. Place it over a 9"" pie dish and trim the edges with a sharp knife.

Berry Filling

* Preheat the oven to 400F. Toss the berries with the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice. and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pie crust. Dot the top of the berries with the small pieces of butter.
* Unwrap and roll out the other disk of pie crust. You can place it directly over top of the berries, or try a design like the lattice style in the photos.
* **Optional:** Brush the top of the pie crust with egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar\*\*.\*\*
* Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until the pie crust is golden brown. Let the pie cool fully to room temperature, then transfer to the fridge for at least 2 hours. Ideally overnight. Slice and serve.

Notes

**How to create a lattice-style pie crust top:**

1. Roll the pie dough on a floured surface to about 1/8″ in thickness. The diameter should be slightly larger than the pie plate. Use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to slice strips from the dough. I sliced mine just under 1″/2 cm, but yours can be any thinness or thickness you’d like.
2. Grab strands of pie dough, matching the lengths of dough with the length needed for the pie plate, and place over the top of the pie, with as much or little space as you want.
3. Still matching strands of dough to the pie plate, start to weave the lattice. Weave by folding back every other strand already on the pie, and placing a new strand down at a 90-degree angle. Bring the folded strands back down over the new strand. Fold back every other strand that hadn’t been folded back before, and place a new strand. Repeat until the top of the pie is covered.
4. Trim any excess dough from the edges and pinch the strands into the edge of the crust. You can leave them like that, or pinch everything together to create your desired design on the crust."

# Ingredients

* 1 lb chicken thigh, cubed
* 2 tbsp rice wine or Shaoxing wine
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced
* ¼ tsp salt
* Pepper, to taste
* Neutral oil, fill pot for frying  


**Sauce**

* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1½ tbsp *gochujang*
* 3 tbsp honey
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced  


**To assemble**

* 6 corn tortillas, sub flour tortillas
* 1 cup Korean coleslaw
* ½ cup kimchi, cut in bite-sized pieces
* Lime
* White sesame seeds, optional
* Kewpie mayo, optional  


# Instructions

1. Make your slaw first and let it sit in the fridge for two hours. Follow my Korean coleslaw recipe.
2. Slice chicken thigh into bite-sized pieces. Marinade in rice wine, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger for 30 minutes.
3. In a pan, mix ingredients for the sauce on low-medium heat. Allow it to bubble and simmer until thick, keep stirring during the process. This should take about 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit on the side.
4. Coat chicken with corn starch. However, only coat what you will fry immediately. If you let the chicken sit too long in the starch, it will become a sludge.
5. In a shallow pot, add in a neutral flavored oil. Ensure the oil is hot (350° F) before you drop in your chicken. Cook in separate batches. Don't crowd the chicken as it will cause the temperature to drop too quickly and you won't get a nice brown outer layer. Fry each batch for 3 minutes.
6. After each batch, remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to absorb some of the oil.
7. Once all the chicken has been fried a first time, put all the chicken back in for a second fry. No need to do this in batches. Fry for about 2 minutes.
8. Heat up the sweet and spicy sauce and add in the fried chicken. Mix well so each piece is evenly coated.
9. Heat up tortillas on a griddle of a pan until softened. Add chicken and top with coleslaw, kimchi, and white sesame seeds (optional). For some creaminess, use a light drizzle of mayo (optional)."

Author: Kylie Perrotti

## Equipment

* Wide pot
* Medium pot

## Ingredients

## Squid:

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 red Fresno chili peppers trimmed and minced; or use crushed red pepper
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 Roma tomatoes chopped
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes left whole
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* ½ cup fresh basil leaves a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 1 pound squid cleaned; tentacles left whole, tubes cut into rings
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* ½ lemon juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Grits:

* 1 cup yellow corn grits
* 3 cups water
* 1 cup whole milk or ½ cup heavy cream
* 3 tablespoons butter
* Salt, pepper, and paprika to taste

## Instructions

## Cook the Sauce Aromatics:

* Heat 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil in a wide pot. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and minced chili pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

## Cook Tomatoes:

* Melt the butter into the aromatics and add the chopped and whole tomatoes. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes begin to break down a bit. Season with salt and pepper.

## Simmer the Sauce:

* Pour in the stock and bring to a bowl. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer over a very, very low boil for 10-12 minutes until the broth is thickened and reduced. Taste and season again to your preferences, adding more crushed red pepper if a spicier sauce is wanted.
* After the sauce has simmered, tear the basil leaves in half and stir into the sauce.

## Prepare the Grits:

* While the sauce is simmering, cook the grits. Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot. Stir in the grits and whisk constantly until they begin to thicken, about 5-10 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to keep the grits from bubbling over too much.
* Whisk in the butter and milk or cream and reduce heat to low, simmering for 10 minutes and whisking occasionally. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste. Keep warm.

## Cook the Squid:

* As the grits finish simmering, cook the squid. Turn to the broiler on high. Pat the squid dry and arrange in an oven layer on top of the tomatoes. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of salt.
* Transfer to the pot to the broiler for 7-9 minutes, checking the squid occasionally, until the squid is opaque and cooked through. Don't overcook the squid.

## Finish the Squid:

* Transfer the pot back to the stove and add the lemon juice.

## To Serve:

* Divide the grits between shallow bowls and pile the squid and tomato sauce on top. Garnish with lemon slices (if desired) and reserved fresh basil leaves. Enjoy!

It ended up being honestly the best tasting whipped cream I've ever tried!

Full recipe from  [https://www.theminichef.com/dalgona-cream-puff/](https://www.theminichef.com/dalgona-cream-puff/) 

### INGREDIENTS

**Cream Puff**

* 1/4 cup butter
* 6 tablespoons water
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs

**Egg Wash**

* 1 egg yolk
* 1 tablespoon water

**Dalgona Cream Filling**

* 10 tablespoons heavy cream (140mL)
* 2 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar (1 1/2 for heavy cream whipping and 1 for making dalgona)
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 tablespoon instant coffee
* 1 tablespoon hot water

### DIRECTIONS

* Add butter, water, milk, salt, and sugar to a small pot. Also prepare sifted flour in a separate bowl and set it aside. Heat the pot on medium-high heat and gently whisk to melt everything together. Once the liquid starts to boil, turn the heat to low and remove the pot from the heat to a cool surface like a stone counter-top
* Immediately add the flour and stir a bit before bringing the pot back to the stovetop on low heat. Make sure that all the flour is fully incorporated. Press the dough against the bottom sides of the pot to remove excess moisture and to cook the flour. Continue for 2 minutes until the dough is thickened and jiggly
* Transfer the dough mixture to a medium-sized mixing bowl. Mix it briefly with a hand mixer or a whisk just to break it apart and let it cool completely
* While waiting for the dough to cool, preheat the oven to 425°F and prepare a piping tip and a piping bag. Also, line a baking sheet with parchment paper
* Beat the eggs in a separate bowl. When the dough has cooled, add half the beaten eggs and whisk until just combined. Add the remaining and whisk again until everything comes together into a smooth, thick mixture
* Transfer the mixture into the prepared piping bag and pipe into spiral mounds on the baking tray. Wet your fingertips and gently touch the tip of each mound to round off the top
* Prepare the egg wash by beating the egg yolk and water together and gently brush the mounds
* Bake in the oven for 10 minutes at 425°F, then lower the temperature to 325°F and bake more for 20-22 minutes. The exterior should be hardened and lightly browned. Let the shells cool completely before adding filling

**Dalgona Cream Filling**

* Whisk heavy cream, 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until medium peaks form
* Combine instant coffee, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and hot water in another mixing bowl. If using a hand mixer, start beating on low until combined then high to make dalgona cream. If whisking by hand, whisk vigorously. The end result should be a fluffy spreadable mixture
* Fold in dalgona into the whipped cream

**Assemble**

* Slice off the top of the cream puffs. Spoon or pipe in the dalgona cream filling to a desired amount"

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 55 minutes

Servings: 4 

Calories: 629kcal

### Equipment

* Wide sauté pan
* Large pot
* Whisk
* Colander, if needed

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 2 yellow onions peeled and diced
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 16 ounces spaghetti, rigatoni, or bucatini
* 1–2 tablespoons smoked shoyu more to taste if desired
* 4 egg yolks
* 2 eggs
* ⅓ cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving
* Freshly grated black pepper
* Salt

### Instructions

#### Caramelize the onions:

* In a wide sauté pan, heat the butter and extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until the butter is frothy and bubbly. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions deepen in color. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent it from burning. About 15 minutes in, add the sugar and smoked shoyu and continue cooking the onions for an additional 15–20 minutes until fully caramelized and deep, golden brown. Season with salt. Turn off the heat.

#### Cook the pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until 1–2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1½ cups of pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Note: depending on how you time it, you may be ready to cook the eggs right as the pasta finishes cooking, in which case, you can just use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water to the pot of caramelized onions. If you aren't ready, just drain the pasta first!

#### Prepare the egg mixture:

* In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks, eggs, parmesan, and ground black pepper to taste. Whisk for 3–5 minutes until smooth and creamy. Set aside.

#### Temper the egg mixture and finish the carbonara:

* Whisking constantly, pour half of the pasta cooking water into the bowl of eggs to temper the egg mixture.
* Return the heat on the skillet of caramelized onions to medium-low. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat with the onions.
* Keeping the heat on low, slowly add the egg mixture, tossing regularly, until completely coated. Turn off the heat as soon as the sauce is coated, and the pasta is warmed through (about 1–2 minutes). If the sauce is quite thick, add more of the remaining pasta cooking water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. It should be glossy and stick to the pasta! Taste and season with salt and more freshly ground pepper to taste.

#### To serve:

* Immediately serve the carbonara in shallow pasta bowls and garnish with more parmesan and black pepper. Enjoy!

Recipe at: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/irish-coffee-mousse/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/irish-coffee-mousse/)

Full recipe, more detailed instructions, and video tutorial at link above.

### Ingredients

* 3.9 oz box of instant chocolate pudding mix
* 1 c whole milk cold
* 1/4 c brewed coffee chilled
* 3/4 c heavy whipping cream
* 1/4 c Bailey’s Irish Cream
* 3 Tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* For a non-alcoholic version, simply omit the Bailey’s and use 1 c heavy whipping cream instead of 1/2 c

### Instructions

* Mix together pudding mix, milk, and coffee until well blended and thickened.
* In a separate bowl (using an electric hand mixer) or a stand mixer, whisk together the heavy cream, Bailey’s Irish Cream, sugar, and vanilla until soft peaks form. Whisk the whipped cream, then when soft peaks are formed, slowly add in the Bailey’s a little at a time. Bailey’s whipped cream! Set aside a small amount for a whipped cream topping.
* Stir one-third of the whipped cream into the pudding mixture until well blended. 
* Next, gently fold the rest of the whipped cream into the mixture, in order to keep the light texture of the mousse. Refrigerate. When ready to serve, top with a bit of whipped cream and a sliced strawberry. Enjoy!
* **Tip:** To determine what type of peaks you have, dip a teaspoon or your beater/whisk into the whipped cream and lift.  If a peak stands up, but then collapses and melts back down, its soft.  If the peak continues to stand up tall, it’s stiff.  Firm peaks are somewhere in between, as they’ll stand up but the tips are mostly folded over.  Don’t overbeat, or [**you’ll get butter**](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/uses-for-heavy-cream/)!"

&#x200B;

**Ingredients for Bigos:**

\* 14.1 oz stewing beef (400g) cut into large dice (chuck, skirt, leg, or flank works well)

\* 8.8 oz kielbasa (250g) smoked sausage, such as podwawelska

\* 5.3 oz lardons (or chopped bacon)

\* 17.6 oz sauerkraut (500g) drained and rinsed

\* 17.6 oz white cabbage sliced

\* 1 large onion diced

\* 1 apple peeled and diced

\* 1 cup dried mushrooms (50g) (porcini or boletus)

\* 4 cups boiling water (1L) enough to cover everything in the slow cooker

\* 1 glass dry red wine (240ml)

\* 1 prune

\* 2 bay leaves

\* 4 allspice berries (or 1/4 tsp allspice powder)

\* 1 tsp marjoram

\* 1 tsp caraway (helps with digestion)

\* 1 tsp honey (add enough to balance sourness)

\* 2 tsp salt

\* 1 tsp ground black pepper

\* 1 pinch nutmeg

\* 1 tbsp tomato puree

&#x200B;

**How to prepare Bigos:**

**1.** Begin by hydrating the dried mushrooms in 1 L of boiling water for around 15 minutes. When ready, remove the mushrooms and strain the water through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any grit or sand. Transfer the mushroom water to a slow cooker dish, leaving behind the last 50 ml (1/4 cup) of water that may contain sediment.

**2.** In a frying pan, sear the lardons and sausage over high heat until browned. Transfer the meat to the slow cooker, leaving the fat in the pan.

**3.** In the same pan, brown the diced onions until softened and lightly browned. Transfer them to the slow cooker.

**4.** Next, brown the diced beef in two batches until browned on all sides. Transfer it to the slow cooker.

**5.** Add all the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker, including the hydrated mushrooms, and stir well to combine. Cover with a lid and set the slow cooker to high heat for 5 hours. After the first hour, give it a good stir and repeat every hour or so to distribute the flavours.

**6.** When the Bigos is ready, remove the bay leaves and serve hot with sourdough bread or boiled potatoes. Bigos tastes better with time, so you can store it in the fridge for up to three days, freeze it, or store it in jars if you make a bigger batch. Reheat it gently on the stovetop or in the microwave before serving. Enjoy!"

# RECIPE:

*Before anyone asks, you can absolutely remove the shrimp tails if you don't like them. I like to leave them on, personally.*

My shrimp came already peeled, but if you have peels on, I highly recommend making your own homemade shrimp stock (just cook the shrimp peels in a few tablespoons butter, add un-peeled, quartered shallot, head of garlic, halved and some celery with leaves and 8 cups water, bring to a boil and then hard simmer for an hour until reduced to 5–6 cups needed for this recipe. strain through a sieve into a large bowl and then discard solids. you can pop the cloves out of the garlic and mash into a paste and add it to the spicy stew if you're feeling fancy)

BUT, if you don't have time for homemade shrimp stock, water (for those watching our BP) or prepared chicken or veggie stock works fine too.

This was super good. It was a remake of a recipe that didn't photograph well, but I made some tweaks and this ended up tasting even better so I'm really happy with it.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 55 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 5 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 394kcal

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Small saucepan for the rice
* Large saucepan or large pot for the shrimp
* Food processor optional, for the roasted red peppers

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 4 carrots peeled and diced
* 5 ounces roasted red peppers drained and minced or puréed
* 2 tablespoons matbucha optional
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste
* 5 cups water or homemade shrimp stock
* 1 pound shrimp peeled, tails on or removed depending on your preference
* 1 lemon
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry parsley or 1/4 cup freshly minced parsley
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder or 4 cloves minced fresh garlic
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For serving:

* 3 cups cooked white rice warm
* A drizzle of hot honey for garnish, optional

## Instructions

## Prepare the stew:

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, and carrots and cook, stirring regularly, for 7–8 minutes until just beginning to sweat and soften. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
* Add the roasted red bell peppers and matbucha if using, and toss to coat.
* Melt the butter into the vegetables. Once bubbly and melted, add the tomato paste and crushed red pepper. Stir to coat the vegetables in the paste and cook for 2 minutes.
* Pour in the water or stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and hard simmer for 25–30 minutes. Stir occasionally and add more liquid as needed or reduce the heat if the stew reduces too quickly—taste and season with salt and pepper. The stew should be thick, not soupy, so be careful not to add too much water.

## Cook the rice:

* While the stew simmers, prepare the rice according to package instructions. For 3 cups of cooked rice, you’ll need 1 cup of dry white rice. Set aside and keep warm.

## Poach the shrimp:

* Bring a large saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Once boiling, cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice from both halves into the pot. Add the lemon halves to the pot and turn off the heat. Immediately add the shrimp, cover, and let stand off the heat for 5 minutes. The residual heat from the boiling water will gently poach the shrimp. Next, remove the lid and check the shrimp for doneness. Cover and let stand in hot water for an additional minute or two if they aren’t fully opaque.

## Finish the shrimp:

* Melt the butter into a bowl. Add the parsley and garlic powder. Using tongs, pick the poached shrimp from the pot and add them to the bowl of melted butter. Toss to coat. Taste and season with salt, if needed.

## To serve:

* Divide the cooked rice between shallow bowls and ladle the hot stew around the rice. Pile the poached shrimp on top. Finish with a drizzle of hot honey, if you like. Enjoy!

- 2 red onions
- 2 celery stalks
- 2 small carrots or 1 large
- 1 red bell pepper (stem and seeds removed)
- 1 poblano chile
- 4-5 portobello mushrooms
- 10-12 cloves garlic
- 2 jalapenos
- 1-2 serranos
- 10-12 assorted dried chiles (I use a mix of 5-6 guajillos, 1-2 pasilla negros, 1-2 ancho, 1 morita and 1 cascabel). Seeds and stems removed.
- 1/2 pound dried black beans
- 2-3 pounds of ground beef in 2 packages.
- 1 pound stew meat
- 1 29 oz. can tomato sauce
- 3-4 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- several pinches of mexican oregano
- 2 quarts beef stock
- 1 quart chicken stock
- 1 bottle of beer
- salt and msg to taste
- cilantro
- Cayenne powder
- Valentina hot sauce

Steps:

1. Soak beans in cold, unsalted water overnight
2. Drain and rinse beans
3. Cover beans with beef stock. Bring to boil then reduce to simmer. When liquid level gets too low, add water and keep at a simmer.
4. Put one onion (quartered), both stalks of celery, 1 carrot (or half a large carrot), the poblano, one of the jalapenos, half the red bell pepper, several cloves of garlic, and the mushrooms on a roasting sheet and put in the oven on 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. The skin on the poblano and jalapeno should be charred and blistered and there should be light charring on the onion.
5. Remove skin, stems and seeds from the poblano and jalapeno. 
6. Add all the roasted ingredients (poblano, jalapeno, half the bell pepper, garlic, carrot, celery, and mushrooms, ) to a food processor or sturdy blender and blend to a fine paste.
7. In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add some olive oil and the roasted vegetable paste. Add salt. Allow the moisture to cook out of the ""mirepoix"" and the paste to get a deep brown. Stir regularly. Allow around 20 minutes to get a really good depth of color.
8. Add one package of ground beef to pan, mix well with the mirepoix mixture and break it up thoroughly. Add salt and some chili powder. Let the moisture cook off and the meat to get a deep brown. This may take another 20-30 minutes. Stir frequently.
9. Meanwhile, toast the dried chilis briefly in a hot pan, be careful not to burn them. Transfer to a small pot, cover with chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Allow them to simmer 10-20 minutes then remove from heat and set aside.
10. Dice the other onion into large dices. Dice the remaining bell pepper. Cut the carrot into small circles (like in a classic beef stew). Cut the remaining jalapeno and the serranos similarly. Slice the remaining garlic into thin slices.
11. In a large stock pot, add some oil, and _half_ of the diced onions. Use medium heat. Allow them to soften and just begin to get some color, then take the remaining ground beef and drop into the stock pot in large chunks. Add salt and 1-2 tablespoons of chili powder, as well as some cumin. Cover and let the large chunks of ground beef to cook until light brown. Pour off some of the grease.
12. Add the dried chilis as well as the stock they simmered in to the food processor or blender and process until a smooth paste or liquid. Taste for heat level. Remember, it will be diluted a lot by the rest of the ingredients, so don't be afraid of a bit of kick.
13. Add the meat and mirepoix mixture to the stock pot, along with the beans and their cooking liquid, and the mixture of dried chilis from the food processor. Add the beer and tomato sauce and bring to simmer. Mix well.
14. Sear the stew meat in the saute pan just long enough to get some color, then add to the stock pot.
15. Brown your remaining veggie ingredients (the last of the onion, the carrots, bell pepper and jalapeno/serranos and garlic). Add them to the stock pot.
16. Add garlic powder, cumin, mexican oregano and remaining chili powder to stock pot.
17. Taste and add salt, MSG, cayenne powder and hot sauce to taste and preferred heat level.
18. Cover. Let simmer 1-3 hours (the longer the better). Add beef stock or beer if more liquid is needed. Taste frequently and adjust with additional salt and chili powder as needed.
19. In last 5-10 minutes of cooking, add your fresh cilantro.
20. Serve with shredded cheddar cheese, cotija cheese and fritos scoops (or your preferred chili toppings).

*Adjust for spiciness by leaving out the serranos, cayenne powder and hot sauce. If you leave out the hot sauce, add a bit of lime juice for acidity. Try not to reduce the dried chilis or chili powder, as they are an essential part of the flavor.

**To remove the seeds from your dried chilis in the most efficient way possible, use a pair of scissors to cut the top off with the stem, and then cut long ways down the chili. Then just run your finger along the inside to remove the seeds."

* ¾ cup hot water
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 shallots peeled and sliced into thin wedges

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken (I used half chicken thighs, half chicken tenders but use whatever is on sale!)
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 large carrots, peeled and large-diced
* 1 tablespoon dry thyme
* 10 cups water
* 3/4 cup white rice (I used short grain)
* 1/2 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste

METHOD:

**Prepare the chicken:**

* Pat the chicken dry and dice it into cubes. You'll break it apart later with a fork, so it doesn't have to be perfect.
* Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.

**Brown the chicken:**

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large soup pot over medium-high. Cook the chicken in batches for 3–5 minutes on each side until browned all over. Transfer it to a plate.

**Cook the aromatics:**

* If the pot seems too dry, add another drizzle of oil. Add the onion and carrots and cook for 5–6 minutes. Add the thyme and cook 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper.

**Simmer the soup:**

* Add the chicken back to the pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low and hard simmer for 30–40 minutes until cooked through. Shred with a fork after it's tender if you like. You can also leave the pieces whole if you don't feel like fussing with breaking the chicken apart. Season the broth liberally with salt and pepper.

**Cook the rice:**

* Bring the soup back to a boil. Add the rice and reduce heat to medium-low. Hard simmer for 30 minutes until tender. The broth should reduce down and be pretty rich at this point.
* You can add a bit more water in 1/2 cup increments if the rice absorbs too much liquid!

**Finish the soup:**

* Stir in the dill and taste the broth and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more dill if you like.

Our hazelnut chicken meatballs with orzo is a great way to enjoy meatballs with a delicious, buttery tomato broth. This meatball recipe is easy and tasty!

If you don’t have hazelnuts or hazelnut flour, simply use almond flour or breadcrumbs if you’re not concerned with carbs!

Note: I prefer boiling my chicken meatballs as opposed to fry or baking simply because it saves time, is less hassle, and cooking the meatballs right in the broth allows them to absorb the broth and stay moist! Frying or baking these before adding to the broth would be perfectly delicious, if that’s what you prefer!

# Grade:

Serves: 4

Cost: About $3.45 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 45 minutes (10-15 minutes inactive)

# Ingredients Hazelnut Chicken Meatballs with Orzo

**Aromatics:**

1 yellow onion, peeled and minced

2 red Fresno chili peppers, trimmed and minced

5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

**Chicken Meatballs:**

Half the minced aromatics

1 pound ground chicken

1 egg

1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

1/3 cup mascarpone or heavy cream

1/2 cup hazelnut flour *(Make this by running 1/2 cup whole hazelnuts through a food processor until finely chopped, like almond flour)*

Salt and pepper to taste

1 teaspoon espelette powder, optional

**Broth:**

1 teaspoon neutral cooking oil

Remaining half the minced aromatics

3 tablespoons butter, optional

1 quart fresh cherry tomatoes, halved

4 cups stock

8 ounces dry orzo

Salt and pepper to taste

**For Serving:**

Minced parsley

More grated parmesan

# Method

**Prepare the Meatballs:**

In a bowl, combine all the ingredients for the meatballs and mix gently until all the ingredients are incorporated. Fry up 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture and taste for seasoning. Gently roll into 2” diameter meatballs without over-mixing or over-rolling. Transfer to a plate and set aside in the fridge to chill.

**Prepare the Soup Base:**

Heat the neutral cooking oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the remaining half of the aromatics and cook, stirring frequently, for 4-5 minutes until softened.

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and season every with salt and pepper. Cook in an even layer for 5 minutes until the cherry tomatoes soften and begin to char. Add the butter to the pot and stir frequently, whisking it into the released tomato juices. Taste and season again with salt and pepper.

Pour the stock into the pot and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Taste and season and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low.

**Cook the Meatballs:**

Drop the chicken meatballs into the broth and cover. Cook for 5 minutes or until they have firmed up just a bit but aren’t quite cooked through. Return the broth to a low boil.

**Cook the Orzo:**

Once boiling, add the orzo and cook, stirring regularly to keep it from sticking, for 8-12 minutes or until the orzo and meatballs are both cooked through. Taste and season again to your preferences.

**To Serve:**

Divide the orzo and chicken meatballs between bowls and garnish with parsley and parmesan, if desired. Enjoy!"

170g (6oz) of butter

100g (3.5oz) of plain flour (you can also use gluten-free flour mix)

120g (4.2oz) of cocoa powder or dark chocolate (you can use a mixture of both, 60g of cocoa and 60g of chocolate or use only one ingredient depending on what's in your cupboard)

tiny pinch of salt

(optional) 1tsp of vanilla bean paste (or extract)

**Instructions:**

1.Preheat the oven to 180C (356F).

2.Melt the butter in a small pan.

3.Add dark chocolate to the butter and whisk until melted.

4.In the bowl, mix eggs with vanilla, white and brown sugar.

Be very careful not to add too much butter to the base as this will solidify it too much and you will not be able to dig in. We finish this layer with a nice shot of espresso but you can try different things to your liking.

**Chocolate Middle**

This layer is basically thick chocolate ganache with the liquor, you can skip alcohol completely and substitute it with almond extract or other baking aromas.

**Cheesecake Topping**

For this creamy layer, I like to use full-fat Philadelphia cheese, you can opt for a lighter version and lower the amount of sugar by half but why would you do this? It is a sin worthy dessert! I always recommend vanilla bean paste over the extract but use what's in your cupboard and it will still taste superb. You can also add any type of citrus zest that you like to create another layer of freshness in this dessert.

**Garnish**

If you go for simplicity and a more classical look cocoa powder is just fine. To elevate more use crushed dark chocolate or super tasty chocolate espresso beans.

**Ingredients for base:**

150g (5.3oz) of chocolate digestive biscuits

30g (1oz) of melted butter

3tsp of strong espresso

**Ingredients for chocolate layer:**

250g (8.8oz) of milk chocolate (drops or finely chopped)

150ml of double cream

100ml of coffee flavoured liquor like Tia Maria or Kahlua

**Ingredients for the cheesecake layer:**

150g (5.3oz) of cream cheese

100ml of double cream

1tsp vanilla bean paste

50g (1.7oz) of icing sugar

cocoa powder for garnish

**Instructions:**

For this recipe, you will need 5 dessert jars or glass bowls.

1. Crush chocolate digestive biscuits in a bag with a rolling pin then transfer to a bowl, combine with melted butter and 3tsp of strong espresso. With a help of a spoon transfer to glass bowls/jars and create a flat bottom layer then place in the fridge.
2. For the chocolate layer, place a bowl over a pan of simmering water and add the double cream, chocolate drops and liquor. Once chocolate melts, gently stir with a spatula until combined and pour into the jars. Place back in the fridge to set for 3-4h.

Tip: When cooking over simmering water (Bain-Marie): Make sure that the bowl doesn't touch the water, you want the steam to transfer the heat and do the cooking.

3. Once the chocolate layer is set you can proceed with the cheesecake, to do so use a hand or standing mixer. Beat the cream cheese to soften up then add vanilla bean paste, icing sugar and double cream. Whisk until stiff peaks then transfer to jars. Dust with cocoa powder and place back in the fridge for a couple of hours.

4. You can keep Tiramisu Cheesecake in the fridge for up to 3 days. Enjoy!

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/emse22,https://i.redd.it/bvdac6scxy941.jpg,reddit,"Here's the recipe for my oven roasted porchetta sandwich with salsa verde, grated caciocavallo, on a sourdough sesame roll. Local cheese from Jersey Cheese and pork sourced from NK Prime Meats.

You’ll find countless porchetta recipes that all use different cuts of pork (from pork shoulder to pork belly) but the traditional method uses a large section of pork belly with the ribs removed and the loin still attached. If you can’t find a butcher who can prepare this more specialized cut for you, a compromise would be taking a skin-on cut of pork belly and a piece of pork loin, and working backwards to recreate the original cut. [**I made this short video where you can watch the exact process of how the meat was broken down and rolled together with a blend of aromatics.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmYsbIotBVM&feature=youtu.be)

**The filling:**

Finely dice fennel fronds, rosemary, sage, and garlic and mix together in a medium size mixing bowl. Add dried & crushed hot chili flakes to taste. Add zest of one lemon. Add 2 teaspoons of dried fennel seed powder, salt and pepper. Add oil oil so the entire mixture comes together like a thick paste. 

Remove the skin from the belly and set aside for later. Next cut the  loin to the exact size of the belly and butterfly it open to maximize  the surface area of the meat. Set the loin piece aside and spread the  aromatic filling all over the surface of the pork belly, fat side down.  Lay in the butterflied loin piece and generously spread more of the  filling all over the meat. Carefully roll up the belly and loin and  position with fat side facing up. Rub more paste all over the top before  laying on the piece of skin that was previously removed.

Using butcher's twine, you want to carefully truss the porchetta every few inches so that the whole piece is secure during cooking. Using a sharp boning knife, make small punctures all over the surface of the skin so that the fat renders out during cooking. Wrap porchetta and refrigerate for 6 hours to overnight. Allow to sit out at room temperature before putting it into the oven to allow the meat to relax, yielding a more tender piece of meat.

**Roasting:**

Set porchetta into a roasting pan with rack to keep the meat elevated during cooking. Cook for 40 minutes at 475F before lowering the temperature down to 300F for another 2 - 4 hours until the internal temperature reads 155F. The skin should puff up as it cooks and result in an airy, crispy texture. If skin still feels rubbery, use the broiler (with a very careful eye not to burn it) to finish off the skin before removing from the oven. Allow the meat to rest 30 minutes before slicing. 

**Salsa Verde:**

Using a food processor, blend together two bunches of parsley, garlic, a few spoonfuls of capers, 3 fillets of anchovies, juice of one lemon, a few splashes of white vinegar, and a few glugs of olive oil.

**Porchetta Sandwich:**

Slice porchetta in thin slices and set aside some of the crispy skin. Layer meat on a freshly baked sourdough sesame roll ([recipe here](https://www.saucesandwich.com/blog/sourdough-sesame-rolls)) and top with salsa verde and freshly grated caciocavallo cheese (or provolone).

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11kylp0,https://i.redd.it/4kjn6fzcvcma1.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients:

For the crust:

* 3 cups vanilla wafer cookies (6-7 ounces)


* ¼ cup cocoa powder


* 6 tablespoons butter, melted



For the whipped cream:

* 2½ cups heavy or whipping cream


* ½ cup confectioner's sugar


* ½ teaspoon cream of tartar (optional)


For the filling:
* 6 ounces semi-sweet baking chocolate


* 16 counces cream cheese, softened


* Pinch of salt


* 1½ cups confectioner's sugar


* ½ cup Baileys Irish Cream liqueur


* Sprinkles to decorate: St. Patrick's Day-themed, green, or your choice



Directions:

1. Place the bowl and whisk attachment for your mixer into the freezer.

Make the crust:

1. (The crust requires a brief baking. See the notes below for a no-bake option.)

2. Preheat the oven to 325° F. Have a 9-inch pie plate ready.

3. Grind the vanilla wafers into fine crumbs using a food processor. (If you don't have a food processor you can crush them in a bowl using a pestle or a heavy-bottomed glass.)

4. Add the cocoa powder to the crumbs and pulse the food processor to blend them in. With the motor running pour in the melted butter and run the food processor until the chocolaty crumbs are thoroughly saturated. 

5. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate, using the bottom of a glass or a pastry tamper. It should be a firm, even layer over the entire bottom and sides. 

6. Place the crust in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Move the crust to a cooling rack. The crust will have puffed a little: use the glass or tamper to gently press it down and against the sides. Allow the crust to cool completely. 

Make the whipped cream:

1. Assemble the chilled bowl and whisk on the stand mixer. 

2. Pour the whipping or heavy cream into the bowl. Beat the cream on medium-high for a minute. Stop the mixer; add in the ½ cup of confectioner's sugar and the cream of tartar if using. (Cream of tartar will help whipped cream stay set for longer, but if you don't have any, don't worry about it.)

3. Whip the cream for another 2-4 minutes, until stiff peaks form. 

4. Remove 2 cups of the whipped cream and put them in the fridge. (This will go on at the end.) 

5. Transfer the rest of the whipped cream to a bowl and hold it aside for the filling.

Make the filling:

1. Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave it in 30 second blasts, stirring after each one, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set it aside to cool—it must be at room temperature before it goes into the filling.

2. Wipe out the mixer bowl. Add in the softened cream cheese and the pinch of salt; beat the cream cheese on medium until it's whipped and smooth.

3. Add in the 1½ cups of confectioner's sugar; beat it into the cream cheese until the mixture is smooth, scraping down the sides once or twice during mixing.

4. The chocolate should be room temperature—once it is, scrape it into the mixing bowl. Run the mixer on medium-low, scraping the sides once or twice, until the chocolate is fully incorporated.

5. Pour the Baileys Irish Cream into the bowl and run the mixer on medium speed to incorporate it.

6. Take the whipped cream you set aside in the bowl: use a rubber spatula to gently fold it into the chocolate-cream cheese mixture, using big strokes to pull the mixture from the bottom up and over the top. (This is to keep the mixture light and airy.)

Assemble the pie:

1. Spoon the chocolate-Baileys filling into the cooled crust. It's a lot of filling and will be higher than the edge of the pie plate, but should be firm enough to stay in place. Use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly and smooth the top.

2. Take the 2 cups of whipped cream from the fridge. Spread this evenly over the top of the pie filling.

3. Loosely cover the pie with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge to chill and set for at least 4 hours or overnight.

4. Once chilled, add sprinkles to the top: you can use stencils to create shapes or just sprinkle them all over.

5. Slice the pie and serve immediately. Store any leftovers covered in the fridge for up to 4 days.

Once I started making lots of homemade soups I found that I couldn’t go back to canned soup anymore, which was a bummer because I also didn’t want to go through the hassle of getting and handling fresh clams to make clam chowder myself. 

This recipe uses canned clams and it’s the perfect middle ground in my opinion! Canned clams are an excellent source of iron, and they are cheap and last for a long time in the pantry! 

# Ingredients

* 2  6.5 oz cans of clams
* 1  8 oz bottle of clam stock (clam juice) \*see note
* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into \~1 cm cubes \*see note
* 4 strips of thick cut bacon (or 6 regular strips)
* 1 large white onion, diced
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 2 cups whole milk (can sub non-dairy)
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* ⅔ cup corn (from one cobb, or sub canned)
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme
* ½ cup shredded carrots (optional)
* 1 bay leaf (optional)
* Salt & fresh cracked black pepper

# Instructions

1. Strain the clams over a measuring cup, reserving the liquid (should get about 1 cup total). Combined with the 8 oz bottle there will be 2 cups of clam stock, set this aside.
2. Heat a large, wide pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and cook it until it reaches your desired level of doneness (I like to let some get crispy and pull some off a little sooner). Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the drippings in the pot. 
3. Add the onions to the pot and cook in the bacon drippings until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Add some extra olive oil if the bacon drippings don’t coat the bottom of the pot)
4. Add the potatoes, garlic, 1 tsp salt, and ¼ tsp pepper to the pot. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. Dust the flour evenly over the contents of the pot and cook, stirring frequently, for another \~3 minutes.
6. Add the milk and clam stock and stir until well-mixed. Add the bay leaf, thyme, carrots, and corn. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low to simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes (stirring occasionally to prevent potatoes from sticking to the pan's bottom). Add more salt and pepper to taste.
7. Add the clams and bacon bits to the soup 2-3 minutes before serving. Remove the bay leaf and serve the soup topped with more thyme and fresh cracked black pepper.

# Notes

* Serve in bread bowls or alongside crusty bread for dipping.
* Dicing the potatoes into small (\~1 cm) chunks is critical to the texture of the soup, the outsides of the pieces dissolve and contribute to the creaminess of the soup. If cut too large this won't be as effective.
* Clam stock (clam juice) can usually be found near the canned clams at the grocery store in 8 oz glass bottles.

Makes 2-4 servings (2 in my house lol)

Ingredients:  

* 16 oz udon noodles (using @lotusfoods brown rice udon)  
* 2 bundles scallions chopped (ends removed)  
* 2 cups sliced shiitake (destemmed)  
* 3 garlic cloves minced  
* Around 1-2 inch ginger minced  
* Just a smidge avocado oil  
* Sesame seeds for garnish  
Sauce, stir to combine:
* 1/3 cup coconut aminos (using @nutiva)  
* 1 tsp molasses (using unsulphured blackstrap)  
* 2 tbsp fresh lime juice  
* 1 tbsp honey or sweetener of choice  
* Couple drops sesame oil  
* Couple pinches of salt  

Directions:  

1. Over medium heat add a little avocado oil to coat bottom of pan (I use like a little over a tsp). Add in scallions, cooking for 20 min to get that char. Stirring every so often.  

2. Once you are towards end of scallion cooking time, can get your noodles cooking in salted water as directed on package. You want to be able to add these in immediately after they are done cooking.  

3. Then add in you shiitakes to brown, cooking for about 5 more mins. Letting sit for a few minutes then stir.  

4. Add in your garlic and ginger, stirring and cooking till fragrant. Around 30 seconds. Turn heat to low and add in your sauce to combine.  

5. Toss in your cooked noodles! Garnish with sesame seeds and enjoy.  

Note:
* for my oil free friends, can easily adapt this to oil free! You can try to char scallions in the oven on broil for around 5 min. Or give it a try on the stove top method, think it would be just fine. Adding maybe a smidge of water if needed at all to help with sticking."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ixnd5l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ixnd5l,reddit,"Wild mushroom pappardelle with brown butter, sage, pecorino, and a raw egg yolk. This is one of my favorite times of year and also one of my favorite wild mushrooms - Hen of the Woods, or Sheepshead, or Maitake, Grifola frondosa. They’re easy to miss if you don’t know what to look for. This could be substituted for any of your favorite mushrooms, but I personally love how the meatiness of the Hen of the Woods stands up against the heft of the pappardelle. Recipe as follows [and a short video about the process can be found here.](https://youtu.be/Lj8cB_371Kw)

**Pappardelle**

Ingredients

450 g 00 Flour

250 g eggs (beaten before mixing)

\*Portioned for 5 - 6 people

Directions

&#x200B;

1. Dump out the weighed      flour onto a clean work surface.
2. Use your hand to      form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.
3. Carefully pour      your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork.      Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs      with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.
4. After about 5 -      10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using      your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5      minutes until it is no longer shaggy.
5. Use the edges of      your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth      ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it      again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.
6. Cut the dough      into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least      30 minutes.
7. The following      steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you      could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough      balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover      the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.
8. Pass the dough      through the sheet pasta attachment at it’s widest setting. If it feels      sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the      pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through      until it is light and delicate. For pappardelle, I normally go to the 5th      setting.
9. Allow the sheet      of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife,      trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds,      over and over until you have a nice compact roll.
10. Using your      knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 3/4 - 1 inch      (1.9 - 2.5 cm) pieces. I like my pappardelle nice and wide. With your      fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina.      You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until      all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.
11. Cook right away      or store in the fridge covered with a towel.

&#x200B;

**The Pasta**

Ingredients

Wild mushrooms thinly sliced (.5 lb or 250 g)

Butter (1 stick or 120 g)

Garlic (3 cloves finely minced)

Pecorino romano

Black pepper

Sage

Egg

Pasta Water

Directions

&#x200B;

1. Bring a large      pot of water to a boil.
2. Bring a large      skillet to medium heat.
3. Add the thinly      sliced mushrooms to the pan and dry saute for a few minutes, stirring      frequently and careful not to burn. This will remove some of the water      weigh of the mushrooms before you add the fat. Add a drizzle of olive oil      and a sprinkle of salt. Stir again.
4. Add in the      butter and bring to a low simmer, continuing to stir.
5. Add the sage and      garlic, continue to saute and stir for another ten minutes until the      mushrooms are completely cooked through and tender.
6. Meanwhile, cook      your pasta to your liking and be sure to reserve a little pasta water to      lubricate the noodles if necessary.
7. Drain the pasta,      and transfer the noodles directly into the pan with the mushrooms and      browned butter. Toss well so all the noodles are completely covered in the      sauce. Add pasta water (or any extra browned butter) as necessary if it      feels too dry.
8. Plate each dish      with the pappardelle and mushrooms. Create a small well in the middle of      each plate for the egg yolk.
9. Very carefully,      crack and egg and discard of the egg white. Gently place an egg yolk in      the middle of each plate without breaking it.
10. Add a generous      sprinkle of freshly grated pecorino to each plate, along with black pepper      to taste.
11. Enjoy!

By using the Tarte Tatin method, you can skip parbaking the pastry, use extra topping without soggy crust, and the tomatoes cook faster over direct heat. 

See [**Step-by-Step Video Instruction**](https://youtu.be/ixKK7Fham7o) for following along. 

**Ingredients:**

* 6\~8 campari tomatoes, halved
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
* 2 tbsp mustard 
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
* 1 tsp herbs de province
* 1 tsp fresh basil
* 1 sheet puff pastry or pie dough

**Instruction:**

Grease a 9 inch non stick pan with olive oil. Line halved tomatoes in  pan, cut side up. Sprinkle herbs de province on the tomatoes. Heat the  pan on medium heat for 2 min, covered. Top with grated Parmesan. Remove  from heat.  

Roll out pastry to the diameter of the pan. Brush pastry with Dijon  mustard. Leave about an inch around the edge. Cover the pan with the  pastry. Fix the edges so that the tomatoes are thoroughly covered. Poke  holes with a knife to allow steam to escape.

Bake at 420F for 10\~12 min, or until puffed & slightly golden. To  flip. make sure you're using heat pad or mittens. Cover the pan tight  with a large plate, and flip quickly. A little spilling is normal. Wipe  away any spilling with a paper towel, and fix the tomatoes if any were  crooked. Top with fresh basil, Enjoy!"

# Ingredients

* 8 Poblano Chiles
* 2 tbsp Butter
* 1/2 Large White Onion thinly sliced
* 2 Garlic Cloves minced
* 1 cup Sweet Corn
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 cup Whole Milk
* 1 cup Sour Cream
* 4 oz Cream Cheese
* 1 cup Shredded Mozzarella or Monterey Jack Cheese
* Nachos or Warm Tortillas for serving

# Instructions

1. You can roast the chiles over a gas stove, roasted under a broiler or over a barbecue grill.
2. Our preference is to use the broiler in our oven. Arrange a rack in the top position of the oven and preheat the broiler to high. Arrange chiles poblanos on a sheet pan and char under the broiler, turning, until all sides are charred, 2-4 minutes per side.
3. Transfer the chiles poblanos to a large bowl, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let the chiles steam for 20 minutes.
4. Carefully remove the stems, peel and seeds from each chile. Cut the chiles lengthwise into 1/2 inch wide strips and set aside until ready to use.
5. In a large skillet, over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, garlic, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is lightly browned, around 8 minutes.
6. Add the poblano, corn, cream cheese, sour cream and milk and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.
7. Add the shredded cheese and cover the pot and turn off the heat. Let it sit covered until the cheese has melted.
8. Serve with tortillas chips or warm corn tortillas."

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/linguine-with-clams/](https://maplewoodroad.com/linguine-with-clams/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 8 ounces linguine
* 4-5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 50 little neck clams (2 pounds)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced (1-2 tablespoons)
* ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 cup dry white wine (eg Sauvignon Blanc)
* ½ cup reserved pasta water
* ¼ cup fresh Italian flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
* Kosher salt to taste

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Start bringing the pasta water to a boil. When you add salt, use a little less than usual. 
2. While following the steps below, cook 8 ounces of pasta slightly less than al dente, as it will finish cooking in the sauce.
3. In a saucepan large enough to fit the clams in no more than about two “layers,” heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil, add the clams, and cover with a lid. Shake and stir occasionally. It will take about 8-10 minutes (depending on the heat) until the clams open up.
4. When the clams have all opened up, put a strainer in a bowl to catch all the cooking liquids when draining the clams. 
5. Remove the meat from most of the cooked clams, but also leave some in the shell. The clams left in the shell make an excellent presentation when serving, and the clams removed from the shell will get the full pan sauce treatment on all sides.
6. Using the same saucepan you just cooked the clams in, heat 4 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, and add 1 tablespoon (or 2) minced garlic and ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes. Let the garlic (and pepper flakes) soften for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
7. Put the clams (including the ones you left in the shell) back into the pan and give it a good stir. 
8. Crank up the heat and add 1 cup of dry white wine (Sauvignon Blanc works great) and let the wine reduce (steam) for about 5 minutes. Reduce heat.  
9. Add ½ cup pasta water and the cooked and drained pasta, and give it another good stir. Taste and add salt as needed.
10. Drizzle with another 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and ¼ cup finely chopped Italian parsley. Use tongs to serve. Enjoy!"

* 1 whole bulb of garlic, diced
* 1 tbsp diced ginger
* 2 cups of kimchi (optional)
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 4 tbsp sesame oil
* Salt (1-1.5% of the weight of your pork)
* Pepper to taste
* For a vegetarian filling, replace pork with equal parts firm tofu and your choice of mushrooms. Use vegetarian kimchi. Blend up the tofu and mushrooms so they're somewhere between crumbly and smooth (if it's too smooth, the texture gets weird)

I do a quick marinade for the steak and chicken (don't follow the measurements, I just eyeball it):

* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon white sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* If you have it, get some Chile de Arbol Ground Chili from your Mexican section at grocery store, super spicy but adds a lot of flavor, add more cayenne if you don't have this and want some more spice

Slice up chicken breast, coat it in olive oil, and mix in some of the spice rub. Coat flank steak in olive oil, coat in spice rub. Let them both sit for 30 minutes to many hours.

Sear flank steak in a pan until charred on both sides and done to your liking (these were pretty rare to medium rare), set the flank steak aside to be sliced up after it rests for a bit.

Add vegetables to the pan, I like to cook them after the flank steak to pick up all the good bits, cook them on high for a minute or so and remove.

Add the chicken to the pan, cook through (don't overcook chicken breast, and don't over-crowd the pan or you're just going to boil it in it's own juices), add everything back to the pan like the picture. Done!"

60mL or 1/4 cup Whole Milk

5 tbsp Evaporated Milk or Heavy Cream

2 Whole Eggs

135g or 2/3 cup Sugar

2 tsp Instant Coffee Powder, sifted

75g or 1/4 cup Condensed Milk

2 tsp Vanilla Extract or Paste

Boiling water for water bath

**Ingredients for Vanilla Sponge**

120g or 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter

200g or 1 cup Sugar

4 Whole Eggs

4 tbsp Milk Powder or Evaporated Milk

6 oz White Chocolate

125g or 1 cup All Purpose Flour

1/2 tsp Baking Powder

1/2 tsp Salt

**Cake Preparation**

Preheat oven to 350F/175C.

Grease the sides of a round 9-inch Spring form pan with butter.

Melt chocolate and butter together.

Take off heat and mix in sugar and milk powder/evaporated milk.

Add eggs one at a time and fold together.

Sift in baking powder, salt, and flour, mix together well. 

Pour into pan and bake for about 40-45 minutes or until skewer inserted comes out clean.

The top of the cake will dome and turn a nice golden brown color.

Let the cake cool and then trim the top to flatten it. 

**Coffee Cheesecake Filling Prep**

Cool oven to 320F/160C. Bring a kettle of water to a boil, this is for the water bath.

Wrap the bottom of the cake pan with foil, it’s best if you wrap it multiple times to ensure a nice waterproof seal.

Soften cream cheese by microwaving for 45 seconds and then place in blender.

Blend cheese, yogurt, and all the milks together(condensed, whole, and evaporated/cream) until smooth.

Add in eggs, sugar, vanilla, and coffee then blend together well. Make sure you scrape down the blender sides to ensure no lumps are present.

Pour cheesecake filling onto vanilla sponge and place pan in water bath. You want to pour enough water around the pan that it covers half of it. Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes then turn off the oven and bake for an additional 45 minutes. The center will be a little jiggly, that’s okay. 

Remove from oven and run a pallet knife around the edge to release cake from the pan. 

Let it cool for 1 hour on the counter before chilling in the fridge for at least 6 hours. Overnight is ideal but 6-7 hours will work in a pinch. 

Before cutting,  run a knife under hot water and then wipe it dry. This will help you to get a nice clean cut.

Serve with fruits or a dollop of whipped cream up top."

* 8 ounces pumpkin puree
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* Whole cloves, to help mimic pumpkin stems
* Toothpicks or food safe string, for shaping

&#x200B;

**Instructions**

* Prepare the pumpkin by draining some of the liquid out. To do this line a bowl or a strainer with a few layers of paper towels, then place the pumpkin puree on top of the paper towels. Let this sit for 10 minutes.
* Gently mix together all of the ingredients in a large bowl. A soft but pliable dough will form, if the dough is too wet or sticky, add additional flour as needed 1 tablespoon at a time.
* Sprinkle a little flour on a clean countertop or cutting board.
* Taking about 1 tablespoon of dough at a time, roll the dough between your palms to create a ball shape, set the ball onto your floured surface. Repeat this until all the dough has been rolled.
* Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil, season the water with a pinch of kosher salt.
* Using the side of a toothpick or a piece of string to create pumpkin markings on each dough ball, then very gently press down the top just a bit to make the ball a little more squat in shape.
* Once all of the gnocchi are shaped and the water is boiling, carefully slide them into the pot of water.
* Let the gnocchi boil until they begin to float, once they are floating give them another minute or two then take them out of the water.
* Place a whole clove into the top of each gnocchi to look like a pumpkin stem. 
* Serve gnocchi with your favorite sauce! (it is recommended to remove the clove before eating.)

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/i7kh8u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/i7kh8u,reddit,"INGREDIENTS

* 1.5 pound fresh, steamed and mashed ube
* 1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk
* 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
* 1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk
* 1/2 cup butter
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 tbsp ube extract (optional, helps with color and aroma though!)

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Take the ube, cut it into small chunks, and then steam them in a steamer until a fork can be easily inserted into them
2. Mash up the ube and then put it in a blender with the can of coconut milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk
3. Blend until the mixture is smooth
4. Pour the mixture into a large pot and mix in the sugar
5. Put in the butter and turn the heat on to medium high
6. Continuously stir the pot as the mixture heats up in order to ensure that the bottom does not stick and burn
7. The mixture will need to go over the heat for 30-45 minutes (really depends on how thick you want the jam!), until thickened
8. If you want a thicker consistency then you can keep heating the ube jam past 45 minutes, but if you want a more spreadable consistency then remove from heat once the mixture takes the form of a thick soup (it'll still thicken in the fridge as it cools!)
9. Once done, remove from heat and store in an airtight container in the fridge, and then enjoy on toast or milk teas or ice cream!

* 2½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 head of garlic, top cut off
* Salt

**Stew**:

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 leek, white part only; trimmed, scrubbed, and sliced into rings
* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced
* 3 carrots, peeled and diced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 cup yellow split peas, rinsed and picked over
* 4 cups chicken broth from above
* 5 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken, onion, bay leaf, and head of garlic in a pot. Cover with 6 cups of water. Add more if needed to submerge the chicken fully. Add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the chicken is completely cooked.
2. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a bowl. Transfer the garlic to a small plate.
3. Turn the heat on the broth to medium and continue simmering until it reduces and deepens in color, about 10–15 minutes. Reduce the liquid to about 4 cups. It’s okay if you have a little more or a little less.
4. Strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.

**Prepare the chicken and garlic:**

1. Carefully pick the chicken from the bones. Shred the chicken and set it aside. You can freeze the bones for stock if you like. You can fry the chicken skin for a crunchy garnish or discard it.
2. Pop the garlic cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste with a fork. Set aside.

**Make the stew:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the leek, celery, fennel, carrots, and sauté for 10–15 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent them from burning. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the dry thyme, garlic paste, and yellow split peas to the pot. Toss to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt.

**Simmer the stew:**

1. Pour in 4 cups of broth and shredded chicken. See note.
2. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes or until the yellow split peas are very tender. Cook for 30 minutes if you prefer a firmer split pea; longer if you prefer a creamier texture. Stir occasionally and gently mash the split peas, adding more water if the broth evaporates too quickly. Taste and add salt and pepper.

**Finish the stew:**

1. Once the stew is thick and creamy, stir in half the minced scallions and the lemon juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the stew into bowls. Garnish with the remaining scallions. Enjoy!

***Note:*** 

*If you have less than 4 cups of broth, add more water to supplement. If you have more, start with 4 cups of broth and add the remaining as needed. You can also add all the broth and simply simmer it a little longer.*"

 \*\*INGREDIENTS\*\*

* Live crawfish, 1 sack (+/-40lb)
* Red Potatoes, 3lb
* Onions, 3lb
* Garlic, 6 bulbs
* Carrots, 3lb
* Whole Corn, 3lb
* Whole Mushrooms, 16oz
* Smoked Sausage, 3lb
* Crab Boil Seasoning, 10 cups (Zatarains)
* Lemon shrimp & crab boil, 8 oz bottle (Zatarains)
* Garlic & onion shrimp & crab boil, 8 oz bottle (Zatarains)
* Lemons, 2 whole
* Orange, 1 whole

#### Seafood Dip

* Mayonnaise, 2 cups

* Onion Powder, 1 tbsp
* Garlic Powder, 1 tbsp
* Cajun Seasoning, 1 tbsp (Tony Cachere's)

### Instructions

1. Soak live crawfish in water for about 1/2 hour, removing dead crawfish. Drain and soak again for a further 1/2 hour.
2. Bring large pot of water to boil.
3. While crawfish are soaking prepare vegetables - chop carrots into long pieces. Cut onions in half. Chop sausage into long pieces.
4. Add 2 cups of crab boil to water.
5. Put potatoes, garlic, onions, carrots and sausage into basket and drop into the water. Boil for 10 minutes. Add corn and mushrooms and cook for another 10 minutes.
6. Take vegetables out and put into ice chest to keep warm.
7. Add another 8 cups of crab boil to the water, to boil the crawfish in.
8. Dump crawfish into basket (that the veggies were in) and when the water is back boiling drop the crawfish.
9. Cook crawfish for 4 minutes (timed once the water gets to boiling point again).
10. Turn off heat and allow crawfish to soak in the pot for a further 10 minutes.

### Notes

It takes about 7 pounds of live crawfish to produce 1 pound of peeled tails.

You do have to be concerned about cholesterol. Crawfish tend to be higher in cholesterol than most other shellfish. And what you put in the pot can add to the mix.

*Serves ~6 people*

*I eyeballed the ingredient amounts but will try and write approximations.*

Ingredients:

* ~2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
* ~20 cloves of garlic finely chopped, ground, or minced
* 5-6 stalks worth of basil leaves (use holy basil or regular basil here)
* 1-2 heads of broccoli
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 red bell pepper

* Oyster sauce (~10 tbsp for marinade and another 4 tbsp for stir fry sauce)
* 2 tbsp Hoisin sauce
* 1 tsp Fish sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Light soy sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Dark/sweet soy sauce
* A few pinches of corn starch
* A few pinches of MSG if you have it although I forgot it this time and still tasted great
* 1 tbsp sugar (also optional - the sauces already add some sweetness)

Procedure:

Slice the chicken into strips and then marinate in plenty of oyster sauce for at least 30 min to an hour but the longer the better.  Fry the chicken strips in peanut oil or another good frying oil on medium heat for ~ 5 minutes on each side or until you see the sauce begin to caramelize on the chicken and it's cooked through.  Set your chicken aside and then, if necessary, add a little more oil to the pan and throw in all of your minced garlic.  Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.  Stir the basil around until it gets all saucy and nice.  It's important not to really cook the basil but to let the very low or residual heat and sauce do their work on it while you mix it in."

Recipe:  
**Plain Buns**

* All Purpose Flour (800 grams)
* Yeast (8 grams)
* Sugar (40 grams)
* Water (400 grams)
* Canola Oil (as needed)

**Alternative Buns**

* Pumpkin, Sweet Potato, etc (250 grams)
* All Purpose Flour (300 grams)
* Sugar (40 grams)
* Yeast (3-4 grams)
* Water (as needed)
* Canola Oil (as needed)

Other ingredients for decoration: Food coloring, Dried Dates, Beans, etc

1. Prepare your choice of starch (potato or pumpkin etc) and peel, cut into small pieces. Steam until it is extremely soft. This can take from 20-40 minutes depending on what you use. Potato takes much longer than Pumpkin.
2. Mush and mix into a paste, then add the sugar and yeast, give it a mix. Start adding flour in increments and begin to knead the dough together. Dough should feel very flexible, but not sticky. Knead for about 5 minutes then let the dough rise for 30 minutes. Knead for another 3 minutes and let rest for 1.5-3 hours or until doubled in size.
3. At this point if the dough still feels kinda sticky you can knead in some more flour. Knead into a ball and cover with saran wrap. Take small pieces of dough out and mold the dough into whatever shape you need. Watch video for some technique and examples.
4. Once finished, let each bun rise for another 20 minutes and then steam for 15 minutes. Be sure you have some parchment paper under each buns. Done!

To prepare plain white dough:

1. Mix a cup with water, yeast and sugar. Then add in increments into a bowl with flour and begin kneading. Same exact steps as above. Knead, rest, knead and rest. Then shape as needed."

* Salt and pepper
* Freshly minced parsley, optional

**Instructions:**

**Preheat oven to 400ºF.**

**Brown the beef:**

1. Heat the neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook for 12–15 minutes until browned. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Turn the heat to high and cook for an additional 5 minutes to crisp up the edges of the beef. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Strain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pot.

**Cook the vegetables:**

1. Add the yellow onions, carrots, and celery to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

**Prepare the gravy:**

1. Add the tomato paste and the garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes, mashing the paste into the vegetables as it cooks.
2. Add the flour and toss to coat. Cook for 2 minutes more.
3. Add red wine and turn the heat to medium-high, stirring to lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Pour in the Worcestershire sauce and beef stock.

Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes until thickened. Stir occasionally and add a splash of water or beef stock if the liquid reduces too quickly.
5. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs.

**Make the potatoes:**

1. Add the potatoes to a large pot of salted water and bring them to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes until fork-tender. Drain the potatoes into a fine-mesh sieve.

1. If you have a ricer, rice the potatoes. Alternatively, place the sieve over a large bowl, use a spatula or a large measuring cup, and press the potatoes through the sieve.

**Prepare the mashed potatoes:**

1. Add the melted butter, milk, and white pepper to the potatoes and mash until smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt.
2. Prepare the cottage pie: Grease a baking dish with butter, if needed. Pour the gravy into the baking dish and spoon or pipe the mashed potatoes on top. Smooth it out with the back of your spoon.

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 3/4 cup pearl couscous
* 2 teaspoons Pesto Pantesco or tomato pesto of choice or use tomato paste
* 4 cups water or vegetable stock
* 1 cup fresh or frozen peas
* 4 ounces baby spinach
* 1/3 cup mascarpone cheese or heavy cream
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Shrimp:**

* 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the shrimp:**

Pat the shrimp dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Transfer the refrigerator until needed.

**Start the broth:**

Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the butter. Once the butter is melted and frothy, add the diced onion and cook, stirring often, for 6–8 minutes until softened.

**Simmer the couscous:**

Add the crushed red pepper and the couscous to the onion and cook 1 minute until toasted. Add the Pesto Pantesco to the pot and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in the water or stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until the couscous is al dente.

**Finish the couscous:**

Taste the broth and season with salt, pepper, and more crushed red pepper if you like. Increase the heat to medium. Once it begins to bubble, add the peas, spinach, and mascarpone or heavy cream. Reduce heat and simmer for 6-7 minutes until the spinach is wilted and the peas are bright green. Taste and season the broth once more. Turn off the heat.

**Sauté the shrimp:**

While the spinach and peas simmer, prepare the shrimp. Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over high heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the shrimp in an even layer. Cook without moving for 2–3 minutes or until the edges of the shrimp begin to char slightly. Flip and cook an additional 2–3 minutes or until opaque. Turn off the heat and transfer to a bowl.

**To serve:**

Ladle the pearl couscous into shallow bowls and arrange the shrimp on top. Enjoy!"

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1.5 pounds chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes

Marinade

* 1 tbsp five-spice powder
* 2 tbsp light soy sauce
* 3 cloves of garlic, finely minced
* ½ tsp white pepper
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp Shaoxing cooking wine
* 1 egg (whites only)

For frying

* ½ cup cornstarch
* ½ cup potato starch or tapioca starch
* 1 cup of Thai Basil
* Oil (vegetable, canola, peanut or grapeseed)

Seasoning powder

* ½ tsp five-spice powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp white pepper

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. **Trim fat and cut to size.** This is an optional step. Trim some of the fat off the chicken thighs. If you prefer a juicier fried chicken you can leave it on. Cut the chicken thighs into 1-inch pieces.
2. **Marinade.** In a medium bowl combine the chicken thigh pieces, five spice, light soy sauce, minced garlic, white pepper, black pepper, salt, sesame oil, sugar, egg white and Shaoxing cooking wine. Mix until all the chicken thigh pieces are well coated. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour. Overnight is recommended so the flavor is absorbed into the meat.
3. **Combine the seasoning powder.** Combine the five-spice, salt, white pepper and Sichuan peppercorns. Set aside.
4. **Coat the chicken thighs.** Combine the cornstarch and potato or tapioca starch on a shallow plate. Dredge the marinaded chicken thighs. Be generous with coating the pieces so you can get an extra crispy piece when fried.
5. **Heat the oil.** Take a pan and add the oil and bring it to 350 Degrees F. I leave it at medium-high heat.
6. **Deep fry.** In small batches add the pieces slowly without splashing the oil. Do not overcrowd or your chicken will not crisp up resulting in limp and super oily popcorn chicken. Fry for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Removed with a slotted spoon and let the oil drip. Either use a paper towel or a rack to let it cool. Repeat this 2-3 times.
7. **Double fry (Optional Step).** Once all the chicken pieces have been deep fry. Double fry to get a crispier chicken. Toss the chicken in the batch and deep fry for 2 minutes. Do not overcook otherwise it may burn.
8. **Deep fry Thai Basil.** Take the basil and toss it into the hot oil. Deep fry for 15-20 seconds or until they are crispy and still green. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on top of a paper towel to absorb most of the oil.
9. **Coat with seasoning powder.** Toss the fried popcorn chicken in a large bowl and coat them with the seasoning powder. Add as much or as little of the seasoning mix.
10. **Plate and top with fried Thai basil.** Plate the fried chicken and top it with the fried thai basil. Enjoy!"

Slice them by rotating them around and carefully cutting the pit out.This dessert has the elements of a refreshing mint julep, with the citrus fruit bringing a nice balance to the sweetness of the sugar.

*Serves 2*

**Ingredients:**

**The Syrup:**

*40ml whiskey*

*60ml dry white wine*

*juice of 2 clementines*

*juice of 1 small lemon*

*1 tsp. brown sugar*

*1 cinnamon stick*

*2 nectarines*

*4 tbsp. mascarpone*

*butter1 heaped tbsp. brown sugar*

*sprig of fresh mint*

*1 cinnamon stick*

*fresh grated nutmeg*

*handful chopped pistachios*

**Method:**

1.) Add all of the ingredients for the syrup into a small saucepan over a medium heat. Cook liquid until well reduced and thick. Keep your eye on it - it will stay consistent before bubbling up and quickly decreasing at a certain point. Set aside and allow to cool.

2.) Add 1 heaped tbsp. brown sugar with about 70m of water to a small saucepan over a medium heat and allow the sugar to dissolve. Add a small knob of butter and keep this simmering on allow heat for a hew minutes.

3.) Place a large knob of butter in a frying pan, enough to coat the surface. Set the pan to medium heat and allow butter to melt and heat up before adding the cinnamon stick and sliced nectarines, skin side up. Let the face of the fruits caramelise and take on some colour for about 2 minutes. Mind that your butter does not darken too much, turning the heat down if necessary.

4.) Grate fresh nutmeg over the nectaries. Turn them over and add the brown sugar and water mixture into the pan. If the sugar hardens add a little more water into the pan. Spoon the mixture over the top and cook the nectarines down, turning as necessary until they are soft all the way through while still holding their shape.

5.) Serve the nectarines with freshly torn mint leaves , a pinch of cinnamon and a generous dollop of mascarpone to top. Add a scattering of crushed pistachios, salted are nice. Spoon the syrup over the top and add the zest of a grated lemon."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/cao429,https://i.redd.it/6js14n0c64931.jpg,reddit,"**Ingredients:**

* 500 g minced beef
* 1 onion
* 3 garlic cloves
* 300 g mushrooms
* 1 can crushed tomatoes
* 4-6 bell peppers (depending on the size of your bell peppers)
* 2 tbsp burrito or taco seasoning
* 150 g feta
* 1-2 tsp salt
* fresh cilantro

&#x200B;

**Method:**

* Preheat your oven on 220 C°.
* Heat olive oil and fry the minced beef until slightly browned.
* Dice onion and garlic cloves. Mince the mushrooms in a food processor.
* Remove from the pan (or move to the side of the plan, if you are lazy like me), add more olive oil if needed and fry the onion until translucent.
* Add garlic and fry for another minute.
* Add mushrooms and fry for another minute or so. They will give off water, and this should be evaporated before you continue with the next step.
* Add the burrito or taco seasoning and salt and stir everything well.
* Add the can of crushed tomatoes and cook for a couple of minutes. The mixture should be relatively dry. I left it for another 5 minutes before I continued with stuffing the peppers. Add a handful of chopped up cilantro and mix.
* Cut the top of the bell peppers and remove the seeds. Stuff them with the beef mixture and place them in a baking pan. Sprinkle as much cheese on top as you want.
* Cook in the oven for around 20-25 minutes. I like my bell peppers to still have some crunch. If you want them soft, leave them longer (35-30 minutes).

&#x200B;

**Notes:**

I have been trying to eat less carbs, so I added mushrooms instead of rice. I actually prefer the version with mushrooms; it gives a very meaty, earthy taste. Another option is to add cauliflower rice instead of the mushrooms. If you want it more spicy, add peppers together with the onion and/or add hot sauce at the end (I sometimes add habanero sauce and eat the peppers with lots of sour cream!). I love feta cheese, but use any cheese you prefer. It works well with cheddar, gouda cheese or mozzarella.

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to add that I popped the tops of the bell peppers in the baking pan as well. I had some stuffing left over so I chopped up the roasted tops and added them to the meat. It will make a nice lunch!"

 I'll copy paste it: 

Ingredients:

For the steak and the potatoes:

1 1/2 lb (650g) flank steak, sliced against the grain
1 1/2 lb (650g) baby yellow potatoes, quartered
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons butter, divided
5 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped
1 teaspoon fresh oregano, chopped
Salt and fresh cracked pepper
Crushed red chili pepper flakes, optional

The marinade

1/3 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon hot sauce (we used Sriracha)
Fresh cracked pepper

Instructions:

In a large bowl, combine the steak strips with soy sauce, olive oil, pepper, and hot sauce. Set aside to marinate while you cook potatoes.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When butter is melted, add potatoes. Cook for about 4 minutes, stir and cook an additional 4-5 minutes until potatoes are golden and fork tender. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
Keep the same skillet over medium heat and add remaining 2 tablespoons butter, garlic, red chili pepper flakes, and fresh herbs. Lay the steak strips in one layer in the skillet, keeping the drained marinade for later. Cook on each side for 1 minute each, until nicely browned – adjust timing depending on how you like your steak.
Right before the steak is done, you can stir in the reserved marinade if you like, and cook for one minute. Add the potatoes back to the pan and heat through. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.
Remove from heat and serve immediately, garnished with more crushed chili pepper, fresh herbs, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the potatoes if you like. Enjoy!"

**Chicken broth:**

* 4-pound chicken, giblets reserved for another use
* 1 yellow onion, scrubbed and quartered (peels left on, if you like)
* 3 carrots, scrubbed and cut into thirds
* 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
* 4 ribs of celery, rinsed and cut into thirds
* 12 cups water, plus more if needed
* Salt

**Chicken barley soup:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 ribs celery with leaves, trimmed and diced; leaves minced
* 4 carrots, peeled, trimmed, and sliced into rounds
* 2 tablespoons butter, optional
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* 1 cup pearled barley, rinsed
* 8 cups chicken broth (from the recipe above), plus 2–3 cups water if needed
* 1/3 cup loosely packed parsley, minced; a pinch reserved for garnish
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the chicken and broth:**

1. Place the chicken in a large pot and add the onion, carrots, garlic, and celery. Season with 1–2 teaspoons salt. Don’t go overboard with salting; it will cook down, and you can always add more later. Add a few cracks of black pepper. Bring to a boil and then cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
2. Carefully remove the chicken from the pot using tongs. Transfer it to a large bowl and let it cool.
3. Return the broth to a rapid simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 30 minutes to reduce the broth further. It will be a dark golden brown.
4. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids.
5. Pick the chicken from the bones and shred the meat with your fingers. Transfer the shredded meat to the bowl of strained broth to keep it moist. Reserve the carcass for stock if you like.

**Prepare the soup:**

1. Wipe out the pot used to make the broth. You may wish to give it a quick rinse in the sink if you like.
2. Place it on a burner over medium-high heat. Add the neutral oil, and once hot, add the onions, celery with minced leaves, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook for 7–10 minutes until they begin to soften around the edges.
3. Melt the butter into the vegetables. Once bubbly, add the thyme, garlic powder, and paprika. Add a few generous shakes of crushed red pepper. Cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.
4. Add the barley and cook for 1 minute until lightly toasted. Season again with a pinch of salt.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the broth and shredded chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30–40 minutes or until the barley is tender. The barley will absorb a lot of liquid; add 2–3 cups of water as needed at the end of cooking. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preferences.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Stir in the minced parsley and lemon juice. Taste and season, and then turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with more fresh parsley. Enjoy!"

An homage to my favorite Peruvian dinner recipes, this Peruvian chicken bowl with potatoes is a flavorful experience of contrasting textures.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Inactive time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 673kcal

## Equipment

* Medium pot with lid
* Baking sheet
* Ovenproof skillet
* Colander

## Ingredients

## Peruvian Chicken:

* 2 pounds boneless, skin-on chicken thighs or boneless, skinless
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 mandarin juiced (or use 1 lime)
* 1 tablespoon Aji rocoto optional
* 1 tablespoon wild mountain cumin or use ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper optional
* ½ teaspoon Mexican oregano
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil for frying

## Butter-Basted Potatoes

* 2 russet or Yukon gold potatoes peeled and cut into thick round cylinders, about 2 inches thick
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt to taste

## Avocado Salad:

* 1 avocado
* 1 Roma tomato diced
* 1 jalapeño trimmed and minced
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro leaves minced
* 1 lime juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Rice:

* 1 cup uncooked white rice
* 2 cups water
* 1 tablespoon butter optional
* Salt to taste

## For Serving:

* Aji verde
* Minced cilantro

## Instructions

## Marinate the Chicken:

* In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the marinade and stir until well-combined. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes as you prepare the rest of the recipe.

## Parboil the Potatoes:

* Preheat oven to 425ºF. Cover the peeled and cut potatoes with water in the medium pot. Add salt and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are almost cooked through, about 8-9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a baking sheet to dry. Sprinkle with salt.

## Prepare the Avocado Salad:

* While the potatoes parboil, prepare the avocado salad. Peel and remove the seed from the avocado. Dice the avocado and transfer to a bowl with the lime juice, minced jalapeño, cilantro, and salt and pepper. Do not add the tomato until ready to serve.

## Cook the Rice:

* Rinse out the pot used to cook the potatoes. Combine the white rice with water, butter, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5-10 minutes.

## Roast the Potatoes:

* Melt the butter in a small bowl and use a brush to brush the tops and sides of the potatoes on the baking sheet. Transfer to the oven for 25-30 minutes or until they are fork-tender and golden brown. Once the potatoes start to turn golden brown, turn on the broiler for 3-5 minutes until the tops are crispy and well-browned. Remove from the oven and keep warm.

## Cook the Chicken:

* While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the chicken. Heat the neutral oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the chicken in an even layer–cooking in batches if needed–skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and well-browned. Transfer to a plate and brown the remaining chicken.
* Nestle all the chicken thighs, skin-side up, in the skillet. It's okay if the skillet is a bit crowded since you've already browned the skin. Transfer to the oven with the potatoes and roast for 15 minutes until completely an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF.
* You may broil the tops with the potatoes, as well, if you'd like to further crisp up the skin. Remove the chicken from the oven and transfer it to the stove top. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Right before serving, stir the tomatoes into the avocado salad. Season once more with salt to taste. Slice up the chicken thighs. Divide the cooked rice between shallow bowls and pile the chicken on top. Spoon the avocado salad on the other side of the bowl and arrange one or two butter-roasted potatoes on each plate. Garnish with more minced cilantro, if you like and a spoonful of aji verde.

**Ingredients:**

- 1kg pumpkin, quartered, seeds removed

- 4 tbsp olive oil

- 100g butter

- 1 large white onion, diced

- 2 medium carrots, peeled and roughly chopped

- 1 leek, white and light green parts only, roughly chopped

- 3 cloves of garlic, minced

- 2 thumb sized pieces of ginger, minced

- 1 greed apple, diced

- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes

- 1 tsp turmeric

- 1 tsp paprika

- 1 large potato, diced

- 200g cooked cannellini beans

- 1l stock

- A bunch of thyme

- A bunch of rosemary

- 400g sour cream

- 3 tbsp white wine vinegar

- Salt and pepper to taste

**Preparation:**

1. Brush 1 tbsp of olive oil over the pumpkin flesh, place cut sides down onto a baking sheet, roast in an oven set to 200 C for 30 minutes or until the flesh is soft. 

2. Place a pot over medium heat, add the butter and 3 tbsp of olive oil, melt the butter.

3. Add the onion with some salt, sweat for 3 minutes. Add the carrots and leek, cook for another 3 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic and apple, cook for 2 minutes. 

4. Add the chilli flakes, turmeric, paprika, potato, beans, stock, salt and pepper. Make a bouquet garni with the rosemary and thyme. Add it to the pot. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.

5. Remove the herbs, add the pumpkin flesh (discard the skin), sour cream and vinegar, then blend until smooth. If too thick, add some water or stock. If too thin - cook and reduce.

The potato in this recipe is completely optional, it adds to the creaminess but it can be omitted. So are the beans - these additionally add some more protein to the soup, making it more hearty.

The green apple adds some acidity, but also optional. 

I used chicken stock, but you could use veggie stock instead to make this dish vegetarian. 

I served the soup with some fried chorizo, roasted pumpkin seeds, chives and toasted bread.

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound ground pork cold
* ¼ cup grated sweet onion details below
* 1 teaspoon ground sage
* 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
* ½ teaspoon black pepper
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon fennel seed
* ¼ teaspoon dried thyme

**Instructions**

1. Use the coarse setting of a cheese grater to grate a sweet onion. Use ¼ cup of the grated onion, including the juices!
2. In a bowl, add ¼ cup grated onion with juices, sage, rosemary, pepper, salt, garlic powder, fennel, and thyme. Mix well.
3. Add in the ground pork and mix until just combined. Try to not overwork!
4. Use a ¼ cup measure to measure out ¼ cup of the pork mixture, and then gently form into a ¼ inch thick patty. Try to not compress the meat too much (you’ll end up with tough sausage). Form all of the patties.
5. Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Add 2-3 patties to the pan in a single layer (no oil needed). Cook for 2–2.5 minutes each side until golden brown and the inside of the patties reaches at least 160℉ (higher is ok!). Repeat for consecutive batches."

I decided to make this spiral-shaped beauty, filled with spinach and soft brine cheese. Moreover, I reached out to our Greek friends and used their ultra thin Filo / Phyllo dough sheets, in order to get a super crisp Kol Borek (Turkish, which translates to ""arm borek/pastry"").

**Enjoy the recipe and the latest episode of United Cuisines on Youtube!**

INGREDIENTS

* Filo / Phyllo dough sheets \[10 oz / 300 g\]
* spinach \[1 lb / 450 g\]
* Turkish ""white cheese"" or Greek Feta \[7 oz / 200 g\]
* vegetable oil \[1/3 cup / 80 g\]
* clarified butter \[3 oz / 90 g\]
* 1 medium-sized onion
* Aleppo chili flakes \[1 tsp\]
* salt & pepper to taste
* sesame & nigella seeds

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wash and roughly cut the spinach, peel and chop the onion into small cubes
2. Sauté spinach in a pan over medium-low heat with a tablespoon of olive oil. Add the first batch of spinach, which will wilt and considerably shrink in size quickly. Using a kitchen tong, turn it upside down, let wilt, add another batch, and repeat till all the spinach is in the pan. Cook for 3 minutes, mixing and turning multiple times. Transfer into a bowl and let cool down
3. In the same pan, sauté the onion with some olive oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, till translucent
4. Grab the spinach, squeeze the water out of it and transfer the greens into the pan. Combine spinach and onion, season with salt & pepper to taste and mix in a teaspoon of Aleppo peppers
5. Transfer into the bowl of earlier, let cool down, crumble the white cheese/Feta over it and combine well
6. In parallel, put the vegetable oil and clarified butter into a small saucepan  and place it over low heat. Let heat up till the butter is fully melted and set aside
7. Grease a round oven-safe dish - preferably metal - with the butter-oil mix
8. Grab one ultra-thin dough/filo sheet and paint it with the butter-oil, before placing a second sheet on top and greasing it as well
9. Spread a generous amount of the spinach-cheese filling along the long side of the rectangle. Grab the sheet at the same end where the filling is and start rolling - not too loose, nor too tight. Place it along the rim of the greased oven pan, follow up with the next rolls and spiral inwards till the pan is fully covered
10. Brush with some more of the butter-oil mix, sprinkle with sesame and nigella seeds and bake at 180°C/360°F on the lower third of your conventional oven for around 45 minutes till golden and crisp. Monitor the process, as baking/browning can vary strongly depending on your oven
11. Enjoy!

*makes enough for 2 hungry people*

**Ingredients**

* 2 large onions
* up to 5 garlic cloves (optional – amount depends on your mood/tastes/what you have)
* 3 Tbsp salted butter
* fresh thyme, as much as you like
* 1 large or 2 small bay leaves (optional – amount depends on your mood/tastes/what you have)
* 6 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1-2 Tbsp honey
* 2 small sheets of store-bought puff pastry, or enough to cover your pan
* salt
* pepper

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F and small oven-proof frying pan to medium-high heat. Remove puff pastry from freezer to thaw.
2. Peel and cut the onions horizontally across their middle. If using, peel the cloves of garlic.
3. Add enough butter to the pan to coat its bottom generously, and put in a small handful of thyme and (if using) the bay leaves.
4. Once the herbs start getting fragrant, pour in the balsamic vinegar and honey and give everything a swirl to combine. The more honey you use, the stickier/more caramelized the tart will be.
5. Add the onions to the pan, cut side up. Pop in the garlic if using. You should have enough liquid in the pan to spoon a bit over the onions. If not, add a small splash of water and give the pan a gentle swirl to combine the juices. Spoon them over the onions, then season everything generously with salt and pepper and some more thyme leaves.
6. Flip the onions so they are now cut-side down. Cover the pan with a lid and reduce heat to medium-low. You’ll want to leave the onions in long enough so that they can soften a bit and absorb the flavours in which they are bathing. This should take about 15 minutes, give or take. Then remove the lid to let the liquid caramelize, turning the heat up if necessary to help the process.
7. While the liquid caramelizes, roll out your puff pastry to ensure it will neatly cover your pan.
8. Once onions are tender and ready, place the pastry over the pan, using a wooden spoon to tuck the edges in snugly around the edges.
9. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the pastry is nicely golden and puffed up. Remove from the oven (be careful! the pan handle is hot!). To do so, cover the pan with an upturned plate, hold the handle with a thick dishcloth or oven mitt, then confidently flip the pie out of the pan and onto the plate. If using bay leaves, remove before serving.
10. Bring to the table and enjoy! To complete the dish, pair with a green salad and garnish the pie with additional thyme leaves, lightly seasoning the top with a bit of flaky salt plus some freshly cracked pepper.

**Notes:** if you want to make enough to feed 4, or two people twice, you may want to use a medium-large pan so as to fit double the amount of ingredients.

Servings: 10

Calories: 654kcal

## Equipment

* 2 Large pots
* Colander or sieve

## Ingredients

* 4 ounces diced pancetta
* 1½ pounds boneless short ribs
* 1 pound loose hot Italian sausage
* 1 pound ground beef
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil if needed
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 2 carrots peeled and small-diced
* 2 ribs celery trimmed and small-diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 cup dry red wine
* 2 28- ounce can whole-peeled tomatoes
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 teaspoon sugar optional
* 24 ounces pasta such as paccheri, rigatoni, or pappardelle
* Salt pepper and crushed red pepper to taste

## For serving:

* Grated parmesan cheese
* Freshly minced parsley

## Instructions

## Cook the pancetta:

* Place the diced pancetta in a large pot. Turn the heat to medium. Stir occasionally for 4–5 minutes until the fat renders and the pancetta browns. Remove from the pot and transfer to a large bowl.

## Brown the short ribs:

* Pat the short ribs dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the short ribs in the pancetta fat and cook over medium-high heat for 3–5 minutes per side until browned all over. Transfer to the bowl with the pancetta.
* Add the sausage and beef and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the bowl of pancetta and short ribs.

## Cook the aromatics:

* If needed, add another teaspoon or two of oil and turn the heat to medium-high.
* Add the onion, celery, and carrots and cook for 5–7 minutes. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper.

## Brown the tomato paste:

* Melt the butter into the onions. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds. Add the tomato paste and cook, mashing it into the aromatics, for 2 minutes until it begins to deepen in color. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
* Pour in the red wine and turn the heat to high. Whisk the wine into the paste and continue until the wine begins to boil. Boil for 5 minutes until it just begins to reduce.

## Simmer the ragù:

* Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Stir in all of the meat from the bowl. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, sugar, and crushed red pepper. Add the bay leaves.
* Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 3–4 hours or until the short ribs can be shredded easily with a fork.

## Shred the short ribs:

* Remove the ragu from the heat and carefully remove the lid. Shred the beef and mash any remaining whole-peeled tomatoes. Turn the heat to medium-high and let the ragu low-boil uncovered, for 15–20 minutes. If the liquid evaporates too quickly, add beef stock in ¼ cup increments. Taste and season the sauce.

## Cook the pasta:

* Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta.

## Coat the pasta:

* Return the heat on the ragu to medium. Once bubbly, add the pasta cooking water along with the cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 1-2 minutes. Taste and season once more to your preferences.

## To serve:

* Divide the pasta between bowls and garnish with parsley and grated parmesan cheese.

So here's the lime jellies recipe (they're very sour!). As always, you can watch the [detailed video here](https://youtu.be/6_2f7OXR8iI) (I'd appreciate it if you'd take a look).

**Ingredients:**

* 920 grams (32.5 oz) of limes
* 180 grams (6 oz) of lemons
* 25 grams (1 oz) of gelatine
* 140-180 grams (5-6 oz) of sugar
* 1 gram (1/2 tsp) of vanillin
* green food colouring (optional)

**Cooking method:**

1. Remove the zest from 2 limes. Then cut all the limes and lemons in half and squeeze the juice out of them (you should have about 400 ml or 1 & 2/3 cup).
2. Pour half of the juice into a saucepan. Add the zest, vanilla and sugar (140 to 180 grams, depending on how sweet you want your jellies).
3. Add the gelatin to the second half of the juice. Stir and leave it for 15 to 30 minutes.
4. Put the saucepan with the first part of the juice on the fire and bring to a boil. Once boiling, simmer for 2-3 minutes, and then remove from the heat.
5. Combine both parts of the juice and mix well. Add the food coloring if desired. Then take a mold, cover it with clingfilm and pour the juice into it through a sieve. Put it in the fridge until completely solidified (I recommend leaving it for 1-2 days).
6. When the jelly sets, take it out of the form and cut into cubes. Dessert is ready, enjoy! Be sure to store it in the fridge."

This is for an upcoming project for 5-ingredient vegan meals thus the sparse ingredients! 5 ingredients do not include water, cooking oil, salt, or pepper.

It was still super tasty and is a great recipe to build upon. You could easily add garlic, roasted poblano peppers, or extra plant or meat protein to the soup.

For extra plant protein, I would add white beans or tofu crumbles or top with fried tofu chorizo crumbles.

If you want to do meat, I would do something light like shrimp or chicken.

You can also get creative with toppings like what I suggested below or add some crispy tortillas, crushed crackers, finely chopped tomatoes, or minced red onion.

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
* 5–6 cups of water or vegetable stock
* 2 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob
* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* 6 ounces plant-based cream or coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Sliced jalapeño
* Lime
* Cilantro

**Method:**

Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in the oil for 6–7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they just begin to soften.

Add the quinoa to the potatoes and cook for 1 minute.

Pour in 5 cups of water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once boiling, reduce heat to a hard simmer and cook for 20 minutes or until the quinoa is tender. If the soup is too thick, add the remaining 1 cup water or stock.

Add the corn, cilantro, and cream to the soup and simmer for an additional 5–6 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Ladle the chowder into bowls. Garnish with jalapeño slices, a lime wedge, and a few more cilantro leaves if you like. Enjoy!"

- 2 tbsp (27g) coconut oil
- 15 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped
- 2 tsp (6g) whole black peppercorns and 1 tsp (2-3g) freshly ground black pepper 
- ⁠½ tsp (1g) red pepper flakes
- 4 lbs. (1.8kg) bone-in, skin-on chicken drumsticks and thighs
- 1 cup (228g) unsweetened coconut milk
- ⁠⁠½ cup (115g) coconut vinegar 
- ⁠½ cup (115g) soy sauce
- 8 fresh bay leaves
- Cooked rice for serving

**Preparation:**

1. In a large pot, heat the coconut oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add the garlic, whole peppercorns, freshly ground pepper and red-pepper flakes, drop the temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is toasted and softened and mixture is fragrant, about 5 minutes.

2. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook over medium-high, undisturbed, until fat starts to render, about 5 minutes.

3. Stir in the coconut milk, coconut vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves and 1 cup water, and let the mixture come to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken feels loosened and just about falling off the bone, stirring halfway through, about 1 hour

4. Increase the temperature to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened to a velvety gravy, about 15 minutes. Serve chicken and sauce over rice.

**What I did differently:**

- Replaced coconut vinegar with apple cider vinegar
- Added 2 tsp (8g) white sugar (probably added too much apple cider vinegar and had to offset the strong vinegar flavor) 
- Added enough coconut milk to cover the chicken in the pot, around half a cup more

The shrimp is cooked with the shell on, but it gets crispy and delicious so completely edible.

Originally posted: [Tôm Rim Recipe](https://cookingtoentertain.com/tom-rim-vietnamese-caramelized-shrimp/)

**INGREDIENTS**
  
• 1 kg Shrimp Whole. You want to get a species rather large and with the shell on. You don't need the head although if you do buy shrimp whole make sure to save the head for stock later.

• 50 grams Sugar White sugar works well here but you can use brown sugar or palm sugar if you prefer. The main job of sugar in this recipe is to provide a bit of sweetness, and to start the caramelization process so the sauce really sticks to the shrimp.

• 1 Onion Finely diced. You can use yellow or sweet onions or even shallots if you like.

• 4 cloves Garlic Finely minced

• 1 Chili Pepper This is optional but does add some nice spice to the shrimp. I used a simple green chili but you can add some Thai bird's eye chili if you want it even spicier.

• 1 tsp Ginger finely grated.

• 1 tsp Red Chili Flakes, Optional

• 3 tbsp Dark Soy Sauce You can use whatever brand you prefer. My go to for recipes that are cooked as opposed to dipping is Lee Kum Kee Dark Soy Sauce.

• 1/2 tsp MSG The best option here is Aji No Moto.

• 1/2 tsp Black Pepper Freshly cracked.

• 50 ml Fish Sauce There are so many brands of fish sauce you can use and I can honestly recommend a dozen different ones. Yet my best recommendation for tom rim would be Nguyen Gia as I believe Phu Quoc island makes some of the absolute best fish sauces in the world, and especially for Vietnamese food.

• Spring Onion To taste.

• Cooking Oil As needed. I use sunflower oil most of the time but you can use soy, vegetable, corn, or whatever you prefer. You won't need much, just a tablespoon or two.

**INSTRUCTIONS**
 
1. Use scissors to remove the head and legs from the shrimp. You can optionally remove the tail as well. Place them in a large bowl.

2. Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl except the cooking oil, fish sauce, and green onion. Give everything a thorough mix and place in the fridge for 15-30 minutes to marinade.

3. Set a pan on medium high heat and add oil. When shimmery reduce to medium and add in the shrimp along with all the marinade. Cook until the sauce is thickened and glossy and sticking to the shells. Add the fish sauce and green onion, toss the pan to coat, and turn off the heat.
Move shrimp to a serving dish and enjoy with rice or whatever side dish you prefer."

**RECIPE**

(I believe it yielded ~350g of a marshmallow slab.)

**Ingredients**

100g egg yolks (~5-6 eggs)

2g salt

14g gelatin + 85g cold water (filtered, preferably)

180g sugar

60g water

~10g/2tsp vanilla extract of your preference

**Directions**

Bloom the gelatin in the cold water for 5-10 minutes. Add sugar and the other water quantity to a saucepan and heat on medium. Meanwhile, beat egg yolks and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed with a whisk attachment.

Heat sugar syrup to 240F/115.5C, turn mixer speed to high, and drizzle syrup into the side of the mixer bowl. Beat on high for several minutes, until mixture is cooled significantly and has increased in volume and is pale in color. In the same saucepan, gently melt bloomed gelatin, and add to the mixture, in addition to the vanilla. Beat for five minutes, then spread mixture into a greased loaf pan. Allow to dry for 8 hours minimum (preferably...16, I think). 

Dust a cutting board with an equal mixture of corn starch and powdered sugar (25g each should be sufficient). Unmold marshmallow slab, dust the top, and cut into cubes. Toss cubes in remaining sugar/cornstarch mix."

The high humidity and cold temperatures of this season work in favour of mycelium, bringing us a vast variety of delicious mushrooms. On my short staycation in Lake District, I found a few beautiful Porcini mushrooms that you can see in the picture as well as multiple Larch Boletes referred to in my country as butter mushrooms. They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.  
  
This is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt. It contains pasta and a variety of vegetables that elevate the mushroom flavour. The recipe works with Boletus mushrooms but if not available you can prepare them with chestnut mushrooms instead.  
  
In Poland, mushroom picking is very popular among families and the knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Make sure to always pick mushrooms with someone who knows what they doing, or pick specimens that are hard to confuse, I always recommend signing up for a foraging experience! It is great fun and you can learn something new! :)  
  
This recipe makes 4 portions  
  
  
  
**Ingredients:**  
  
\- 400g (14.1oz) of sliced Boletus mushrooms (or chestnut mushrooms)  
  
\- 1 medium-size onion, diced  
  
\- 4 garlic cloves, sliced  
  
\- 2 medium carrots, small dice  
  
\- half celery stick, small dice  
  
\- 3-inch piece of leek, small dice  
  
\- 1 large potato small dice  
  
\- 1tbsp olive oil  
  
\- 1tsp of butter  
  
\- 1,5L of vegetable stock  
  
\- 150g (5.3oz) of penne pasta  
  
\- 100ml of double cream  
  
\- 1 bay leaf  
  
\- black pepper  
  
\- parsley to garnish  
  
\- 1tsp of yoghurt per plate mixed in before serving (optional)  
  
  
  
**Instructions:**  
  
1.In a frying pan, preheat 1tbsp of olive oil. Add diced onion and 4 sliced garlic cloves, cook on medium heat for 5 minutes or until softened. Add sliced mushrooms with 1tsp of butter and turn up the heat to medium-high, cook for another 5 minutes. Once mushrooms are done remove from the heat and set aside ready for later.  
  
2.In a large pot add 1,5L of vegetable stock, carrots, celery, leek, potato and bay leaf. Bring to the boil and reduce to simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.  
  
3.Next, add 150g of penne pasta and cook for another 10 minutes.  
  
4.Add fried mushrooms, onions and garlic. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes.  
  
5.At this point, pasta should be cooked through and mushrooms should hold the shape, if the soup seems too thick add a little bit more water.  
  
6.Take one ladle of soup with no solids out of the pot and mix it with 100ml of double cream. Pour the mixture back to the pot. (This prevents the cream from splitting)  
  
7.Check the seasoning and serve garnished with freshly cracked black pepper and chopped parsley. You can mix in 1tsp of yoghurt just before serving to increase the sourness to your liking. Enjoy!

I will show you how to make these easy, fast, and healthy fresh spring rolls.

Full recipe with instruction video on how to roll these Vietnamese spring rolls: [https://misterspiceguy.com/recipe/fresh-vietnamese-spring-rolls](https://misterspiceguy.com/recipe/fresh-vietnamese-spring-rolls)

**Ingredients:**

* 6 sheets rice-paper
* 50 gram rice vermicelli
* 12 large shrimps
* 6 large lettuce leafs
* 50 gram cucumber, sliced in strips
* 1 carrot, julienne strips
* 15 gram mint leafs
* 15 gram cilantro
* optional: 10 gram thai basil

**sauce option 1:**

* 2 tbsp hoisin
* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1.5 tbsp thick coconut milk

**sauce option 2:**

* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 2 tbsp water
* 1 tbsp of (palm) sugar
* 2 tbsp lime juice
* 1 finely diced red chili
* ½ clove finely chopped garlic

**Directions:**

1. Start with prepping all your ingredients. So wash your lettuce, cut your cucumber, julienne your carrot and cook the rice vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions. rinse under cold water and set all the ingredients to the side. Now it is time to boil your shrimp in soft boiling water for two minutes, then immediately cool them down in some ice water. I also like to cut them from tail to head down the middle, so you have a more even dispersion and this looks more beautiful in the end result. This is also the time to prepare your dipping sauce(s). For both recipes you only have to combine all the ingredients together!
2. Now it's time to roll! Start by soaking a rice wrapper in cold water for maximum 10 seconds and lay down on a flat and clean surface. Add your filling on top of the wrapper with enough space to the borders and start closing up your spring roll (you can find an [instruction video here](https://www.misterspiceguy.com/recipes/fresh-vietnamese-spring-rolls)). Finish all of them and serve them with you favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!"

1. Add the milk and sugar in a small sauce pan and combine well. Heat on medium heat until the milk is warm to touch.

2. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Then slowly add small amount of warm milk while whisking. While whisking, slowly add the melted butter to the mixture.

3. Set up a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl and add cake flour, matcha powder, and baking powder. Sift half of the dry ingredients into the batter and whisk to combine the dry and wet ingredients together.

4. Sift the rest of dry ingredients and mix until there is no lump in the batter. 

5. Set the fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and pour the batter. This will remove any lumps and get a smooth texture. Cover with plastic wrap to refrigerate for at least 1 hour 

Cooking the Crepes 

1. Set a 12-inch non-stick frying pan on low heat. Pour 1/3 cup of batter just enough to cover the bottom of the frying pan,

2. Cook for 2 minutes then flip and cook for about 30 seconds then transfer to a working surface lined with parchment paper. 

3. Repeat step 1 and 2 with a 10-inch pan and pour 1/4 cup of batter. Continue this process until all the batter is used. 

Whipped Cream

1. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking on lower speed. Once you see bubbles, slowly add granulated sugar. Whip the cream until stiff. 

Assembly

1. First place the larger crepe. This will be the top layer when we flip. Put the freshly whipped cream in the middle and spread evenly, leaving outer 2 inch.

2. Place another crepe on top and spread whip cream evenly, leaving outer ½ inch.
Continue this process until the last crepe is placed on top.

3. Prepare a round curved shallow dish and place a large piece of plastic wrap on top. Make sure to remove any air pockets and smooth out. Transfer the mille crepe to the shallow dish 

4. Wrap the mille crepe with plastic wrap from one corner to clockwise. 

5. Chill in fridge then flip over again before dusting with matcha to serve."

Just as a note — this is for a project for five-ingredient meals (not including salt, pepper, water, and cooking oil) so you can definitely push this further if you like! The challenge is trying to get the most flavor from so few ingredients. 

Some thyme or sage would be delicious in this!

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 pound yellow onions peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 3 tablespoons vegan butter
* Sugar optional, if needed
* 2 15- ounce cans chickpeas
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes peeled and diced into 1” cubes
* 6 cups water or vegetable stock
* ⅓ cup loosely packed parsley minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Caramelize the onions:

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, stirring every few minutes until they just begin to deepen in color. Melt the vegan butter into the onions. If you like, add a sprinkle of sugar to help speed up the caramelization.
* Continue cooking the onions, adjusting the heat as necessary to prevent them from burning, for an additional 30–45 minutes. Stir them regularly until they take on a deep golden-brown color—season with salt and pepper.

#### Simmer the soup:

* Add the chickpeas and the potatoes to the pot and toss to coat. Pour in the water or stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 20–30 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender—taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### To serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh parsley. Enjoy!"

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/](https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/)

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Cinnamon Roll Dough***

* 1 cup warm milk (not hot)
* 2-½ teaspoons instant yeast
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* ¼ cup butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 cups all purpose flour

***Filling***

* ¾ cup light brown sugar, packed
* 2 tablespoons cinnamon
* ½ cup butter, softened

***Icing***

* 6 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1-½ cups powdered sugar
* ⅓ cup butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  


**INSTRUCTIONS**  
***Making the Dough***

1. Place warm milk in a mixing bowl, add yeast, and give it a stir. Let it sit for a minute or two while you’re gathering your other ingredients. 
2. Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour…the dough should be slightly tacky.
3. Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).

***First Rising***

1. Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.

***Cinnamon Roll Filling***

1. In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.

***Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape***

1. For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22” x 14”.
2. Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.
3. Starting at a short end (one of the 14” ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.
4. Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. 

***Second Rising***

1. Preheat oven to 350℉.
2. Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four.
3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they’ve nearly doubled in size.

***Baking Cinnamon Rolls***

1. Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20 – 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they’re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good…they’ll stay soft in the middle.

***Icing for Cinnamon Rolls***

1. While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. 
2. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they’ve fully cooled."

## WHAT DOES STRAWBERRY RHUBARB PIE TASTE LIKE?

Rhubarb loves to be paired with strawberries, and in a pie, they’re BFFs. The tartness of the rhubarb just intensifies the sweet flavor of the strawberries. The overall flavor isn’t overly sweet *or* overly tart; it’s just right."

Making the Dough Starter

Ingredients 

- 6 tbsp milk (89 ml)

- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (16 g)

Directions 

1. Over medium heat, stir together milk and flour in a saucepan until a thick paste forms, about one minute. 

2. Remove from heat and place starter inside a small bowl. Cover and chill starter down to room temperature while you put together the rest of the dough.

Making the Hot Dog Buns

Ingredients

- 1 cup milk (237 ml)

- 1 tbsp active-dry yeast (10 g)

- 4 tbsp granulated white sugar (50 g)

- 3 and 1/8 cup flour (390 g)

- 1 tsp salt (6 g)

- 1 large egg + 1 additional egg for egg wash

- 4 tbsp melted butter (57 g)

- 1 tsp vanilla

- 9 hot dogs

- sesame seeds (optional)

- flaky sea salt (optional)

- 2 tbsp honey for glazing (42 g)

Directions

1. Heat milk in the microwave until it reaches 100 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 43 degrees Celsius). Stir in yeast and sugar and let sit to bloom for 10 minutes.

2. Meanwhile combine flour and salt in a separate bowl.

3. In a larger bowl, combine egg, melted butter, vanilla, chilled starter, and bloomed yeast mixture. Mix until smooth.

4. Then add flour and salt mixture. Using a mixer with a dough hook, knead dough for about 6-8 minutes on medium-low speed, or until you get a smooth, supple dough. A sign you are done kneading is if it passes the “windowpane test” – taking a small piece of dough, slowly stretch it into a thin sheet between your fingers and see if light can pass through the dough without it tearing in the process. Avoid over-kneading. You can knead by hand, but it may take several minutes longer.

5. After kneading, place dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a towel to let rise until doubled in size, about 45-60 minutes.

6. Once risen, roll out the dough on a floured surface using a floured rolling pin. To avoid sticking, you may need to flour the dough slightly as well. Roll until you form a square about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in thickness.

7. Using a knife or bench scraper, cut the dough into 9 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough between your hands and the floured surface into a thin, long rope shape, about 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) long. Wind each rope of dough around a hot dog so it covers the entire length.

8. Space dough-wrapped hot dogs on parchment lined baking sheets about 2 inches (5 cm) apart and cover with a towel to allow to rise one more time (20-30 minutes).

9. Meanwhile, pre-heat your oven to 350° F (177° C).

10. After the second rise, brush the top and sides of your buns with an egg wash made from a beaten egg thinned out with a tablespoon of water. Sprinkle buns with sesame seeds and flaky sea salt if using.

11. Bake for 17-20 minutes, or until buns are golden-brown and no longer doughy on the inside.

12. Place honey in a small bowl and microwave for 10 seconds just to loosen up. Lightly brush buns with honey to add shine and a subtle sweetness.

13. Enjoy! Serve warm with your favorite condiments."

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

* 1-3 pounds pork tenderloin larger size will affect amount of marinade needed
* ⅓ cup marinade of choice (teriyaki sauce, olive oil & vinegar, mustard maple glaze)
* Salt & pepper

**Instructions:**

1. Trim any excess fat off the outside of your tenderloin (optional). Let your pork rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before grilling.
2. Marinate pork, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. I recommend marinating your pork tenderloin right before grilling. The tenderloin is very “porous” so it soaks up the marinade quickly. 
3. Preheat grill to high heat.
4. Grill the pork tenderloin for about 4 minutes a side (4 sides total). Before grilling the final side, check the temperature of the thickest part of the tenderloin to see how close it is to 145°F (done temperature). Grill pork for 0 to 6 more minutes to reach an internal temperature of 145°F (depends on thickness of pork). Total grill time is 12-18 minutes.
5. Let tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain (perpendicular to the muscle fibers) with a sharp chef’s knife."

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/](https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 10 lb pre-cooked ham (approximate weight)
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 c brown sugar, packed
* ¼ c honey
* 1 tablespoon brown mustard
* ½ c pineapple juice
* ¼ c apple juice
* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground cloves  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

* Preheat oven to 325°F.
* Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish, to help keep it juicy.
* If you have a spiral-cut ham, there’s nothing else to do. Otherwise, make ¼″ deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later).
* Place in the oven and bake (a ham will take about 1 to 1-½ hours to cook through). After 1 hour, check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F.
* At about the 1-hour mark, start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
* Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. 
* Once the butter has melted, add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
* Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes. 
* Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
* Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F).
* When it’s getting close to that point, but has about a half hour left, baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham. 
* Fifteen minutes later, brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F.
* Serve and enjoy!"

 [Link.](http://kneadbakecook.com/blog/2016/4/10/strawberry-cream-cheese-scones)

## Ingredients

***Scones***

* 4 oz. cream cheese cut into ½-inch cubes
* 1 cup strawberries cut into ½-inch cubes
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 2½ teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¾ cup cold butter, cut into small cubes
* Zest of one lemon
* ¼ cups of granulated sugar
* ¾ cup cold buttermilk
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* Extra buttermilk for brushing the scones

***Lemon Glaze***

* 3 tablespoons powdered sugar
* 3 teaspoons lemon juice

## Steps

Place cut cream cheese and strawberries on a plate lined with wax paper in the freezer for about 30 minutes. This helps cream cheese and strawberries from getting too squishy.

Preheat oven to 400º F. In a large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg and salt together. With a pastry cutter, food processor or a fork, cut cold butter into flour until approximately pea-sized pieces remain.

In a medium bowl, massage lemon zest in sugar to release the oils. Add in buttermilk and egg and whisk thoroughly to combine. 

Gently fold wet ingredients into dry ingredients and then fold in strawberries and cream cheese until just combined. On a floured work space, knead the dough no more than 10 times or until it just comes together. This will be messy so be patient and don't overwork the dough. Pat into a circle of 1-inch thickness and cut into 8 triangles. Place on a lined baking sheet and brush with buttermilk. 

Bake for 15-18 minutes or until the tops and bottoms are golden brown. Set to cool on a cooling rack. 

To make glaze, whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice. Brush on top of the freshly baked scones.

These scones freeze rather well. Best when reheated in an oven for 5-10 minute or until toasty again."

[Berry Swiss Meringue Buttercream recipe](https://bakerinretrograde.wordpress.com/2020/12/27/berry-swiss-meringue-buttercream/)

Ingredients

- 3 egg whites
- 3/4 cup sugar + 1 additional tbsp
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 tsp lemon juice (or white vinegar)
- 12 tbsp butter
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups frozen berries

Directions

1. Separate your egg whites from the yolks, making sure not a single drop of yolk ends up in the whites. Place your egg whites in a heatproof bowl. Reserve yolks for another purpose.

2. Add in 3/4 cup of sugar and set the bowl over a pot that is simmering with a couple inches of water.

3. Whisk the egg whites and sugar constantly until all the sugar is dissolved. You can use your fingers to feel if there are still granules of sugar in the egg mixture. Then take it off the pot.

4. Add in your salt and lemon juice. Then on medium-high speed, beat the mixture until it reaches stiff peaks. You know you have reached this stage when you can overturn the bowl and none of the meringue falls out. Avoid over-beating.

5. Add in your softened butter about a tablespoon at a time, making sure you mix in between each tablespoon.

6. Mix in your vanilla.

7. Over medium heat, cook the berries with a tablespoon of sugar. Allow the berries to break down, using a wooden spoon to help burst them.

8. Continue to simmer and allow the mixture to thicken and reduce down to about a 1/3 cup of liquid.

9. Take off the heat and strain the berry sauce to get rid of the seeds and fibers.

10. Allow the sauce to cool down before adding to your buttercream."

* ½ cup fresh parsley minced, divided
* 10 ounces frozen peas
* 5 ounces challah bread ⅓ of a 1-pound loaf, cut into cubes
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

**Cook the linguine:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Grease a 13″x9″ baking dish with butter. Set it aside.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add salt and the linguine.
4. Cook until 1–2 minutes under al dente. Reserve ¼ cup pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

**As you wait for the water to boil, prepare the sauce base:**

1. Place the pancetta into a wide pot. Turn the heat to medium. Cook, occasionally turning, for 5–6 minutes until the fat renders and the pancetta is crispy. Transfer to a bowl.
2. Add the mushrooms to the pancetta fat and cook for 8–10 minutes. Add the shallots and cook an additional 5 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper. Stir in the fresh thyme and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute.
3. Turn the heat to medium-high. Add the pancetta back to the pot. Once everything in the pot begins to sizzle, pour in the sweet vermouth and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes until reduced by half. Transfer to a bowl.

**Prepare the roux:**

1. Melt 4 tablespoons of butter into the pot. Once bubbling and frothy, add the flour. Cook for 1–2 minutes, stirring the flour into the butter, until fragrant and golden.
2. Add the chicken stock in ½-cup increments, whisking after each addition to form a slurry. Continue adding the stock in increments until completely incorporated and smooth.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Pour in half the cream and whisk it into the mixture. Add the remaining half and whisk until smooth. Supplement with more water or milk if you like a looser sauce. Season with salt, nutmeg, and white pepper.
2. Add the grated gruyère and ⅓ cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano and stir until completely melted into the sauce.
3. Fold in the bowl of mushrooms, the diced turkey, ½ cup minced parsley, and the frozen peas, and cook until the peas are warm. Taste and season once more to your preferences.

**Prepare the tetrazzini:**

1. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat for 1 minute, adding the pasta cooking water only if needed. Turn off the heat. Pour the pasta and sauce into the prepared baking dish.
2. Transfer to the oven for 10 minutes.

**Make the breadcrumbs:**

1. As the tetrazzini bakes, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a small skillet. Add the challah cubes and cook in the butter until golden brown, about 3–5 minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer to a food processor. Pulse until blended into a fine meal. Transfer the breadcrumbs to a bowl.
2. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano Reggiano and the remaining ½ cup minced parsley to the breadcrumbs. Season with a pinch of salt.

**Finish the tetrazzini:**

1. Remove the tetrazzini from the oven and cover it with breadcrumbs. Transfer back to the oven for an additional 10–15 minutes.
2. Once the tetrazzini is bubbly, and the breadcrumbs are browned, remove them from the oven. At this point, you can broil the top for 1–2 minutes if you like. Otherwise, let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the tetrazzini into shallow bowls. Garnish with more fresh parsley if you like. Enjoy!"

* ⅔ cup lemon juice, or juice of 4 lemons
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* ½ cup plus 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp vanilla
* 3 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 3 lemons

**Vegan Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

&#x200B;

* 2 cups vegan butter or margarine, (stick not spreadable in a tub)
* 8 cups confectioner’s sugar, sifted
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, from about 2 lemons
* 1 tbsp bottled lemon juice, or 1 - 2 tsp lemon extract
* 2 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 2 lemons
* 8 to 14 drops Lemon Yellow food colouring

**To Decorate:**

* Dried Lemon Slices

**Instructions**

**Cake:**

1. Line three 6-inch cake pans with parchment. I recommend using cake strips for a more moist, even bake. Soak in water until ready for use. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.
2. Add the sugar to a large bowl of a stand mixer, then sift in the remaining dry ingredients.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the liquid ingredients including the zest until fully combined.
4. Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the stand mixer and while mixing on low, gradually pour in the wet ingredients.
5. Mix for about 30 seconds or until most of the flour is just moistened and the batter is smooth with a few tiny lumps.
6. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a large spoon or silicone spatula to mix in any dry flour. Don’t overmix.
7. Evenly distribute the batter between the cake pans. If using cake strips, squeeze out excess water, wrap around each pan and secure.
8. Place the pans in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes with cake strips or about 20 to 25 minutes without. A skewer or toothpick inserted should come out clean.
9. Fully cool the cakes in the pans before removing them.

**Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

1. Add the vegan butter and confectioners’ sugar to the stand mixer bowl.
2. Add the bowl to the stand mixer and mix on low while gradually adding the lemon juice and vanilla.
3. When smooth and creamy, remove about ¼ cup of the frosting and set aside. Add the lemon zest and lemon extract to the remainder.
4. Add enough food colouring to get your desired shade of yellow. The colour may darken as the frosting dries.

**To Assemble:**

1. Filling a piping bag, or zip-top bag with the corner snipped, with yellow frosting.
2. Dab a bit of frosting on a cake board, stand or plate. Place the first cake layer on the board.
3. Pipe a swirl of frosting on top, without gaps. Spread evenly then add the second cake layer.
4. Add another swirl of frosting, then the final layer, bottom side up.
5. Spread the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting to crumb coat. Place in the fridge for one hour or until the frosting is chilled.
6. Spread the sides and top with the remaining yellow frosting and smooth.
7. Dab some of the reserved white frosting at random spots on the cake. Smooth to add white streaks.
8. Place the dried lemon slices on the cake and add dots of the remaining white frosting with a #2 piping tip.

**Notes:**

* Warm lemons for about 20 seconds in the microwave, before cutting, for easier juicing.
* Scrape the mixer beater as long strands of zest may stick to it.
* Bottled lemon juice usually has citric acid added which can help add extra tartness and lemony flavour.

**Ingredients**

* 4 large flour tortillas
* 1.75-2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast
* ½ cup ranch or blue cheese dressing
* ½ cup shredded cheddar cheese
* ⅓ cup buffalo sauce like Frank’s Original Red Hot
* 1 medium tomato diced
* 1 small head iceberg lettuce thinly sliced
* 1 small yellow onion thinly sliced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 425℉. Place chicken breasts on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake 17-22 minutes until chicken registers at least 165 degrees in the thickest part.
2. Let chicken rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Use a fork and knife to shred and pull apart chicken into bite-sized pieces.
3. Transfer chicken to a bowl. Use paper towels to gently squeeze out extra juice, so that the chicken juices don’t make the wraps soggy.
4. Toss buffalo sauce into the chicken. Set aside.
5. Add a small handful of lettuce to the middle of a tortilla, then use tongs to add a scoop of chicken.
6. Finally, add 1-2 tablespoons of tomato, a sprinkle of onion, about 2 tablespoons of cheese, and 1-2 tablespoons of dressing. Finish with a drizzle more of buffalo sauce if desired. Don’t overstuff your wrap or you won’t be able to close it! Exact quantities of each ingredient depend on your preference.
7. Making sure the fillings are in the center of the wrap, fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling. Fold up the bottom edge of the tortilla over the filling, holding the sides in place. Rolling the wrap away from you, tuck the filling in as you go. Aim for a tight roll, but not so tight that it tears the tortilla. Fold the side flaps inward before you finish rolling. See the video below for visual instructions! Repeat for other wraps. Enjoy!"

&#x200B;

 

### Ingredients

* 5 boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 1 cup buffalo sauce
* 8 oz cream cheese softened
* ½ cup shredded fontina cheese
* ½ cup shredded sharp cheddar
* 1 oz crumbled blue cheese or gorgonzola
* Black tortilla chips

### Instructions

#### Buffalo Chicken Dip

1. Place chicken thighs into pressure cooker with buffalo sauce. Set pressure on high for 20 minutes. Once done cooking, carefully release pressure manually.
2. Preheat oven to 375 F while chicken is cooking.
3. Shred fontina cheese and sharp cheddar and place in a small mixing bowl.
4. Once the chicken is done, carefully pour buffalo chicken and all the sauce into a large mixing bowl. Shred the chicken and stir well to combine.
5. Add cream cheese and half of the shredded cheese into the large mixing bowl with the chicken.
6. Mix well to combine. Make sure there are no large areas of cream cheese.
7. Add buffalo chicken mixture into a 10 inch cast iron skillet. Top with the rest of the shredded cheese. Sprinkle the blue cheese evenly over the top and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes.
8. Buffalo chicken dip is done when the cheese is melted and the edges are bubbling.

#### Jack-o-Lantern Assembly

1. To make the jack-o-lantern face, take 2 whole tortilla chips and place them for the eyes with the point facing up. Break the tip off a 3rd tortilla chip and place it for the nose.
2. To make the mouth, break pieces to form a smile. Break 2 tips off a whole tortilla chip for the teeth.
3. Place the chips onto the dip right before serving.
4. Serve with tortilla chips, toasted bread or vegetables.

### Notes

* If you don’t have a pressure cooker, you can make shredded buffalo chicken in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours.
* You can replace chicken breasts with chicken thighs but add ¼ cup more buffalo sauce.
* Halloween buffalo chicken dip can be made in a 10 inch round cake pan or pie plate.
* To make ahead: place chicken and cheese mixture in a covered mixing bowl in fridge overnight. When ready for the party, place the mixture in the skillet, top with remaining cheeses and cook. You may need to add a few minutes to cooking time."

**Method:**

1. In a small bowl, mix the milk, water, sugar, and yeast and allow the yeast to activate for 5-7 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, add the flour and make a well in the center.
3. Sprinkle the salt on the outer edge of the flour, and pour the activated yeast mixture into the well.
4. Mix the flour with the yeast mixture, add the butter and mix until the mixture is crumbly.
5. Turn out the dough onto a prep surface, and knead until the dough is elastic (approx. 10-15 minutes). The dough can also be kneaded on low in a stand mixer for 5-10 min).
6. Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl for one hour.
7. When the dough is ready, turn out the dough onto prep surface and divide into 8 equal pieces.
8. Roll each piece into a rope about 24”/60cm long. To shape, make a u-shape and twist the ends together, then bring the ends to the bottom of the u-shape and press.
9. In a pot, bring the water to a boil  with the baking soda. Preheat the oven to 230ºC/450ºF and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
10. Once the water is boiling, drop each pretzel, one at a time, into the pan and leave it for 30 seconds. Scoop the pretzel out with a slotted spoon and place it on the baking sheet.

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/wwdx4c,https://i.redd.it/fpsbxj3jgmj91.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients:

* ¾ cup sugar (¼ for the crust and ½ for the batter)
* ½ tsp. Vanilla (use real vanilla extract)
* 3 x 8 oz. “bricks” of Philadelphia cream cheese (“full fat”)
* 4 tbsp. (½ stick) butter (not margarine)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 cups graham cracker crumbs (you could try chocolate cookie crumbs)
* ½ pint “half-n-half"" cream
* 24 oz. Nestles white chocolate morsels (4 cups)
* Spray-on oil (Pam)

Let the cream cheese warm overnight. Let the eggs warm for an hour.

1. Set up a double-boiler and add the white chocolate morsels and half-n-half. Stir occasionally.
2. In a small pot, put the butter on a low heat to melt.
3. In a small mixing bowl add the Graham cracker crumbs and ¼ cup sugar, and mix thoroughly.
4. In a large mixing bowl add ½ cup sugar, the vanilla and the cream cheese.
5. Mix in the three eggs one at a time, mixing as little as possible; you just want to distribute the eggs through the mixture. I use a large serving fork, and only “pull” through the cream cheese 3 times for each egg.
6. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
7. Spray a springform pan with a medium-to-heavy coat of spray on oil.
8. Add the melted butter to the smaller mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. “Dump” the small mixing bowl contents into the springform pan, distribute evenly, and tamp down lightly and evenly with something with a flat bottom (I use a drinking glass). Only press down with about 18 to 20 pounds of pressure.
9. Stir the chocolate until it's fully melted. Add the melted chocolate to the large mixing bowl.
10. Using a hand mixer on the lowest setting, mix the batter until the largest “shreds” of cream cheese you can see are about 1/8 inch long.
11. Pour the batter into the springform pan, and cover with aluminum foil. Lightly crimp the foil around the top of the pan all the way around.
12. Place in the oven for 1 hour.
13. After the hour, shut the oven off and prop the door open very slightly; don’t open it to the first “detent” (about 3 inches); I use the handle of a wooden spoon inserted as little as possible to keep it in place. After two hours, take the cheesecake out of the oven and put it on the counter for two hours.
14. Take off the foil; at this point you will think the it's “underdone”. The middle will have the consistency of cheesecake pudding. Release the “lock” on the springform pan and use a dinner knife to separate the cheesecake from the pan by running it around the inside edge of the pan. Then open the lock fully and lift the outer part of the pan off the base.
15. Put it in the refrigerator at least 12 hours, 24 is better."

&#x200B;

\-----------------------

&#x200B;

\* Linguine

\* 

\* Two small or one large lobster tail

\* 

\* 4 sticks of COLD butter for the poach, +3 tablespoons for the sauce

\* 

\* 4 cloves of garlic

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh oregano

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh parsley

\* 

\* 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan, +more for plating

\* 

\* 3/4 cup of heavy cream

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Linguine noodles boiled in heavily salted water to just about al dente.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

FOR THE LOBSTER

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The lobster was butter poached, so I took about a tablespoon and a half of water, boiled it, reduced the temperature to low and added a clove of smashed garlic and some cracked black pepper, adding a tablespoon of COLD butter and whisking maniacally until just about dissolved and then adding another tablespoon of butter, repeat that, whisking nonstop until all of your butter is melted. 

&#x200B;

The reason for the nonstop whisking is you're creating a butter emulsification to poach the lobster in. The amount of butter you'll need will vary depending on the amount of lobster you have and the size of your pot. You want the lobster to be fully submerged! 

&#x200B;

The cook time will vary on the size of your lobster tail, so about 5-8 minutes is a safe bet. You don't want to overcook it! 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

FOR THE SAUCE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Start off with 3 tablespoons of butter on medium low temperature to melt it, add 3 cloves of smashed garlic, let that cook for a few minutes to get that butter all garlicy and junk, add the fresh oregano and parsley and about a cup of the pasta water, bring that to a simmer, add a half a cup of fresh grated parmesan, getting it all melty and delicious, after that's all melted, add 3/4 a cup of cream, bring that to a simmer, add desired amount of pasta to pan, get it all stirred up and junk and let it all get to know each other over medium low heat for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens up to your desired consistency!

&#x200B;

Plate up and top with some more grated parmesan and some of that delicious lobster poaching butter sauce! EZPZ"

 I just made the most delicious Chicken Shawarma with homemade Laffa Bread, and I can't wait to share the recipe with you! Juicy, flavorful chicken, wrapped in soft laffa, topped with fresh veggies, tangy pickles, and a drizzle of garlic sauce... it’s seriously next-level.

# Ingredients for the Chicken Shawarma

* 650 g boneless - skinless chicken thighs
* Juice of half a lemon
* 3 garlic cloves - minced
* 1 tsp minced ginger
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil - for the marinade
* Half of the Lebanese spice blend
* Iceberg lettuce - shredded
* Cherry tomatoes - quartered
* Cucumber - halved and sliced
* Pickled element of the salad - lacto-fermented cucumbers or red sauerkraut
* Toum - Lebanese garlic sauce made of yoghurt, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice
* Chilli sauce
* Optional: Drizzle of tahini sauce or a sprinkle of sumac for extra flavor

# How to Prepare Chicken Shawarma:

1. Prepare the chicken thighs by cutting each thigh into halves. Marinate the meat in a bowl with half the Lebanese spice blend, 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and ginger. Allow the meat to marinate in the refrigerator for at least **2 hours or overnight (up to 24 hours for optimal flavor)**.
2. Oven Cooking: Skewer the marinated meat onto metal skewers and place them in a roasting dish. Preheat the oven to **250°C**. Grill the skewers for **10-12 minutes**, turning once halfway, until the meat is charred and cooked through.
3. Alternative Cooking Method: If you don’t have an oven or grill, you can cook the chicken in a cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in the skillet and cook the chicken pieces in batches until well-charred and cooked through **(about 6-8 minutes per side)**. This method replicates the smoky effect of grilling.
4. Once the meat is fully cooked, remove it from the oven or skillet, take it off the skewers, and shred it with a knife.
5. Build your shawarma by layering the flatbread with meat juices, salad, shredded chicken, and sauces. For extra flavor, drizzle with tahini sauce or sprinkle sumac. Wrap it up, and for an authentic experience, use paper and tin foil.

* Cayenne, 1/2 tsp
* Parsley, fresh 4 x Tbsp chopped
* Green Onion, 6 x Tbsp chopped
* Stock, 2 Cups (see below)

#### Seafood Stock

* Crawfish peelings (pan full)
* 2 x Onions 2 x Garlic Bulbs from crawfish boil

### Instructions

1. Make seafood stock - this can be done ahead of time if needed. Take a pan full of crawfish peelings and some vegetables (onions/garlic) from your crawfish boil and boil with water - covered - for an hour. If you do not have the ability to do this step you can just use store bought seafood stock.
2. In a pan melt all the butter.
3. Add the chopped onions, bell pepper and celery (the trinity)
4. Cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes - until the vegetables are clear and soft.
5. Add the flour and continue to cook a further 3 minutes.
6. Add crawfish tails and cook 2 more minutes.
7. Add all bayleaves, continuing to stir.
8. Slowly add the stock, stirring and you'll see it start to thicken up. Add the salt and cayenne and cook for 5 minutes.
9. Add the Parsley and green onions and cook for another 5 minutes.
10. Serve over rice.

### Notes

How the crawfish was originally boiled (seasoning) will determine how spicy this dish is. Depending how much heat you like in your food, the Cayenne can be always increased.

This easy dorayaki recipe makes fluffy, soft castella pancakes and a lightly sweetened filling!  Dorayaki is a popular Japanese confectionary, and its most common variety is honey flavored castella cakes with red bean paste. 

Have you already made this type of dorayaki before? I also included a pretty comprehensive list of others flavors/fillings that you can experiment with!

[Full recipe](https://www.assortedeats.com/homemade-dorayaki/) with other flavors/fillings and more info!

Ingredients

* 4 eggs
* 100 g sugar, 1/2 cup
* 63 g honey, 3 tbsp
* 160 g all-purpose flour, 1 1/3 cup
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 2 tbsp water
* red bean paste

Instructions

1. In a large bowl, add the eggs, sugar, and honey. Whisk well until the sugar has dissolved. The eggs do not need to be fluffy.
2. Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl. Gently whisk the ingredients together until the batter is smooth.
3. Cover and refrigerate the bowl for 15-20 minutes. Five minutes before the dorayaki pancake batter is done chilling, preheat a nonstick pan over medium-low heat.
4. Take the dorayaki batter out of the refrigerator and stir in the water. You may need to add more or less water depending on your eggs and flour measurement. 
5. Pour in a small amount of oil into the nonstick pan and use a paper towel to spread the oil into a thin layer and wipe off excess oil.
6. Add 2 tbsp of the batter into the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes until the bubbles start appearing and popping on the surface of the pancakes. Then, flip the pancakes over and cook for roughly one more minute. 
7. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out and getting tough. Repeat with the remaining batter.
8. Spread a heaping tablespoon or two of red bean paste onto one pancake, keeping the center thicker. Add another pancake on top and pinch the edge of the pancakes together to create one sandwich. Repeat with the remaining pancakes.
9. Store pancakes in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days. If there are still leftover pancakes, you can wrap them individually in plastic wrap and freeze the pancakes for up to one month."

Super fluffy and sweet bun with a savoury mouthwatering stuffing. By the time you finish the first one, you will be thinking about another one!

**What are Kapuśniaczki?**

This Polish pasty is prepared for special occasions like Christmas and throughout the year as a snack. Different types of dough are used ranging from crunchy to more fluffy.

On many occasions, puff pastry is used as well for the convenience of preparation. Wild mushrooms are also used as an addition to the filling giving it more depth and richness. Exceptionally good when served with borscht. In some regions of Poland also called ''Paszteciki''

📷📷

This recipe makes 10 pasties

**Ingredients for the filling:**

* 700g (1.54pounds) of Sauerkraut
* 500ml (o.53quarts) of hot water
* 300g (0.66pounds) of brown mushrooms, cut in half and sliced
* 300g of red onions (3 medium-sized) finely sliced
* 2tbsp of oil
* 1tsp of butter
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 allspice berries
* salt and black pepper

**Ingredients for the dough:**

* 500g (1.1pounds) of plain flour
* pinch of salt
* 60g (2.1oz) granulated sugar
* 60g butter
* 130ml (0.135quarts) milk
* 40ml (3tbsp) water
* 30g (1oz) fresh yeast or 15g (0.5oz) of active dry yeast
* 2 eggs (plus 1more for brushing)
* 2tsp of caraway seeds for topping

**Recipe logistics:**

In this recipe sauerkraut needs to be boiled first, in the meantime, you can prepare the dough as it needs time to prove. Once that is done get going with the second part of the filling. Once the dough is ready, roll it, score it, place the filling inside, wrap, brush and bake - Job done.

**Instructions for the filling:**

**1.** Simmer **700g of Sauerkraut** in **500ml of water** with the addition of **2 bay leaves** and **3 allspice berries** for **2,5h**, remember to cover the pot with a lid. Once cooked through, drain from the liquid, discard spices, allow to cool then chop it with a knife. (Sauerkraut will be nice and soft)

**2.** While waiting for sauerkraut, get a medium-sized frying pan and heat **2tbsp of oil**. Sweat the **onions** in **medium heat** for around **5 minutes**. Next, add **mushrooms** and **turn up the heat**. Pan fry until mushrooms are cooked through and start to brown, then stir in **1tsp of butter** and season with **salt and black pepper**.

**3.** Mix chopped sauerkraut with mushrooms and onions, check the seasoning. It should be slightly salty and sour with little sweetness from onions.

**Instructions for the dough:**

**1.** Begin by heating up **130ml of milk** with **60g of butter** in a small pan until butter is dissolved. Next, transfer this mixture to the different pan, **add 40 ml (8tsp) of cold water** to bring the temperature down. Then mix in your **fresh** **yeast** until dissolved, set aside.

**2.** Mix **500g of flour** with a **pinch of salt** and **60g of sugar**, add **yeast mixture** and **2 eggs**. Mix it until combined and place in the bowl to prove (dough will be sticky, do not add any more flour). **Prove until tripled in size (1-1,5h)**.

**3.** Once the dough is proved, preheat the oven to **165C (330F)** and divide the dough into 10 balls around **100g each**, roll each ball into a **16cm square (6inch)**. Then make **five 3cm cuts on the left and right side of the square**. Place **80g of the filling** in the middle and braid the dough by pulling each cut to the opposite side starting from the left to right. Brush with **egg**, dust with **caraway seeds** and bake on the tray with baking paper for around **20 minutes** (bake in batches or 2 separate trays, remember to give then some space for expansion)

**4.** Remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack, eat while warm you can also heat them up in the microwave on the next day. Enjoy!

 Servings: 3

### Ingredients

* ½ cupheavy cream
* ⅛teaspoonkosher salt
* 3tablespoonsextra-virgin olive oil
* 6 ounceslow-moisture mozzarella
* 9 ouncesSottocenere al tartufo or other truffle cheese
* 3 ouncesFontina
* 12 piecesscallions, white and green parts included, thinly sliced on an extreme bias
* 3 piecesYukon Gold potatoes
* 6 piecesapplewood-smoked bacon
* 2tablespoonsfresh thyme leaves
* 3 large eggs

### Instructions

* Whip the cream and salt in a stand mixer, or with a hand mixer, on medium speed until it reaches soft peaks just stiff enough to spread. Refrigerate until ready to use.
* Remove the racks from the oven and place a pizza stone or a heavy duty baking sheet, underside facing up, on the oven floor. Preheat the oven and stone to 500°F for at least 1 hour. Dust a pizza peel with semolina or cover with a 10 × 10-inch piece of parchment paper. (If you don’t have a peel, use a flat cookie sheet.)
* Place 1 round of dough on a generously floured work surface and dust it lightly with flour. Using your fingertips as though you were tapping on piano keys, gently tap the center of the dough to flatten it slightly, leaving a 1-inch rim untouched. Pick up the dough, ball both your fists, and with your fists facing your body, place the top edge of the dough on your fists so the round stretches downward against the backs of your hands, away from them. Move the circle of dough around your fists like the hands of a clock so the dough continues to stretch downward into a circle. When the dough has stretched to about 10 inches in diameter, lay it on the prepared peel or baking sheet.
* Brush the rim of the dough with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season the entire surface with kosher salt. Brush the surface with ¼ cup of the whipped panna. Scatter one-third of the cheeses over the surface of the pizza. Scatter one-third of the scallions over the cheeses, arrange one-third of the sliced potatoes on top of the scallions, and sprinkle the potato slices with kosher salt. Cut 2 of the bacon slices in half crosswise and lay 1 piece on each quadrant of the pizza. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the thyme leaves over the pizza.
* Place the pizza in the oven by sliding it with one decisive push from the pizza peel onto the stone (or sliding the pizza from the flat baking sheet onto the preheated baking sheet in the oven.) Bake for 5 minutes, or until the pizza is halfway cooked. Crack 1 egg into a small bowl, remove the pizza from the oven, and slide the egg onto the center of the pizza. Return the pizza to the oven until the crust is golden brown and the yolk is still slightly runny, 5 to 6 minutes.
* Remove the pizza from the oven and cut it into quarters, stopping at the edge of the egg so it stays intact, and making sure that each slice of pizza gets a piece of bacon. Sprinkle the egg with the sea salt, sprinkle ½ teaspoon thyme leaves over the pizza, and serve immediately. Repeat the process with the remaining 2 dough balls."

### Ingredients

#### Shortbread Crust:

* 2 cups All-Purpose Flour
* 1/2 cup Sugar
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 cup Vegan Butter (I used butter flavored Crisco for this.)

#### Strawberry and Lemon Filling

* 1 1/4 cup Lemon Juice

* 1/4 tsp Salt
* 1 3/4 cup Coconut Milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup 1 tbsp Cornstarch
* 1 cup (230 grams) Strawberries
* 1/8 tsp Turmeric or Vegan Yellow Food Coloring (Optional)

### Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 350° F. Prepare a 9 x 13 dish by spraying with nonstick spray and lining with parchment paper the hangs off the edges for easy removal later. 
* In a bowl add and mix the flour, sugar, and salt.
* Next, cut the vegan button into cubes or smaller pieces and add tp they dry ingredients. With your hands or a potato masher mix and press the ingredients together until it reaches a crumbly texture. Then press the dough together to form a dough ball. 
* Place the dough ball into the prepared pan. With your hand press the dough into pan until smooth and even. My edges were a bit thick, you can press the dough up along the side of the pan as well if you’d like. 
* Bake the crust in the oven for 20 minutes or until the edges become lightly browned. Once done remove from the oven and let it rest on the countertop. Leave the oven heat on since we will be baking the bars again. 
* While the crust is baking add the strawberries to a blender or food processor and blend until your left with a puree. Next, add 1 tbsp of the cornstarch to the puree and blend again so it’s thoroughly mixed in. 
* During or after the crust is has baked, add the lemon juice, sugar, vanilla extract, salt, coconut milk, remaining cornstarch, and optional turmeric or food coloring to a saucepan and whisk until the ingredients are well combined.
* Over medium heat using silicone or wooden spoon continue to stir the mixture while it heats and thickens. Make sure to stir the bottom of the pan to help the sugar and cornstarch melted and mix into the rest of the ingredients. Once the mixture has significantly thickened, pour ¾ of it onto the crust in an even layer.
* Add the pureed strawberry mixture into the remaining lemon filling. Mix and heat the mixture a bit longer until it’s properly thickened again after adding the strawberry puree. My strawberry mixture didn’t get quite as thick as the lemon layer, but it will set just the same.
* Next, add the strawberry fillings on top of the lemon layer. 
* Return the pan to the oven and cook the bars for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.
* Once cooked remove from the oven and allow it to cool on a countertop for around an hour. After place the pan into the fridge for at least 2 hours to properly cool and set. The longer it chills the more it will firm. 
* Once chilled remove the bars from the pan by pulling it up by the overhanging parchment paper.
* Place on a cutting board and cut the bar into at least 24 squares. Sprinkle with powdered sugar or top with lemon and strawberry slices. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days."

4. After all of the sugar has been incorporated, add the vanilla and peppermint extract.    
Once a stiff peak consistency has been achieved, turn off mixture. 
5. Add small dollops of meringue to the corners of your baking sheet, to prevent the parchment paper from sliding. 
6. Transfer meringue to a piping bag fitted with a large star attachment or with a piping tip of your choice. For added colour, you can add streaks of red gel food colouring to your piping bag before loading with meringue. As you pipe meringue the colour will deposit creating a swirled effect!
7. Pipe your meringues allowing at least an inch of space between each. Bake the meringues on the centre rack of the oven, at 225F for \~1.5 hours. Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for an extra 1-2 hour with the door propped open to allow for continued drying.

* Salmon fillet
* Salt
* Sugar
* Dill or other aromatics

**Directions**

1. Rinse fish of juices from packaging.
2. Combine salt and sugar in a 3:2 ratio by weight. For two fillets, I used 225g salt and 150g sugar
3. Add aromatics to dry brine; use more than you think. For 375g of dry brine, I added 10-15g of dill
4. Lay plastic on a sheet tray and spread brine on the plastic.
5. Lay fish on the plastic and spread brine thickly on top
6. Wrap the fish tightly and place in the fridge for \~36 hours, flipping every 12 hours
7. Remove the cured fish from the plastic and rinse it under cold water
8. Let the cure rest uncovered in the fridge for 1-2 hours to firm up and dry out
9. Slice & serve

Notes:

* Just about any salmon will do so long as it smells good when you pull it out of the package. If it doesn't smell nice enough to eat raw, it won't taste great cured.  I have used king salmon, coho, steelhead, and sockeye. I have bought it from the nice-ass fish monger, I have bought it local line-caught at the farmer's market, I have bought Atlantic Farm-Raised at Costco.
* I have tried with weights and without, it doesn't make a difference to the cure.

### Ingredients

#### Caramel

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup water

#### Custard

* 3 large eggs
* 14 oz sweetened condensed milk 1 can\*
* 12 oz evaporated milk 1 can
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

### Instructions

#### Caramel

* Preheat the oven to 350F. Add the sugar and water to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir with a spoon just until the sugar dissolves. Once the mixture begins to simmer, twirl the saucepan occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat once the color turns golden.
* Pour the caramel into an 8"" or 9"" round cake pan. Tilt the pan to evenly distribute the caramel over the bottom of the pan. Allow it to cool at room temperature while you prepare the custard.

#### Custard

* Add the eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla to a blender. Blend on low speed until the mixture is completely smooth. Let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the bubbles that have formed to pop.
* Spoon any remaining bubbles off the top and discard. Place a fine-mesh sieve over the round pan with the caramel, and pour the milk mixture through it into the pan.
* Place the pan into a large roasting pan, and fill it about 1"" with boiling water. Transfer to the oven and bake for 50 minutes – 1 hour. The custard will still be slightly jiggly. A toothpick inserted should come out moist without any pieces of custard sticking to it.
* Allow the flan to cool completely to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge for 1-2 hours.
* If the pan feels cold to the touch, let it sit in hot water for 1 minute or until slightly warmed to allow the caramel to loosen easier. Place a large plate over the top of the cake pan. Hold the edges of the plate and pan together firmly with both hands. Flip the flan over and onto the plate. You may need to jiggle the pan slightly to loosen it.

### Notes

\*Note for metric users: condensed milk is measured by weight in the USA rather than volume. While the can is physically smaller, the condensed milk itself is quite heavy. That is why a 14 oz(by weight) can of sweetened condensed milk is smaller than a 12 oz (by volume) can of evaporated milk. "

3. Cut into 24 even squares and place 1 piece of cheese into the center.

4. Roll up cheese into dough ball and pinch sides to seal.  Set into prepared pan.

5. Melt butter and stir in seasonings.  Spread onto the tops of the dough.

6. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.

NOTES: 

This may be obvious but I forgot to completely defrost the dough making it very difficult to roll flat with a rolling pin. So yea... defrost the dough!! 


Serve with marinara sauce!!! Yay."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gbh92z,https://i.redd.it/tjjkgd7yd5w41.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients:

1lb of lean white fish (raw) 

1/4 cup fresh cilantro finely diced 

1 cucumber seeded and diced

2-3 Roma tomatoes seeded and diced 

1/4 of a large red onion diced (about 6 oz)

2 avocados

8-10 limes juiced

Salt and pepper to taste

Hot sauce to taste

Optional ingredients:

Fresh jalapeño seeded and finely diced 

Directions:
1. Cut the fish into 1/2 inch cubes and add to a bowl.
2. Pour enough fresh lime juice over the fish to completely cover it. Place it in the refrigerator covered until the fish is white throughout (about 30 minutes). 
3. Put the diced onions in a bowl of ice water for about 30 minutes (while the fish is soaking in lime juice) in order to take a bit of the harsh bite out of the onions. Strain afterward.
4. While waiting for the fish to finish soaking, it is a good time to wash and prepare the rest of the ingredients. 
5. When the fish is done soaking, strain it thoroughly and discard the lime juice. 
6. Gently mix the fish, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and any other ingredients you choose in a large bowl. Avoid using too much pressure when stirring in order to preserve the texture of the fish and prevent it from becoming mushy. 
7. Add salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste. 
8. Dice or slice the avocado, and add it to the bowl. Serve immediately with chips or tostadas. 

Note: 
If you prefer to avoid eating raw fish, the fish can be replaced with cooked shrimp!

11. Add chiles (dried and fresh), pepper, onion and garlic. 
12. Let simmer 20 minutes, then remove cover and reduce sauce.

*A few ingredients used in one or more of the traditional recipes I referenced were not available in my location. ""Screw"" chiles, ""millet"" chiles, and angelica. I've left out or made substitions.

**Matcha madeleine**

* 1/2 cup unsalted butter (an additional 2 tablespoons of butter for buttering the madeleine tray)
* 2 large eggs (room temperature)
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 tablespoon matcha powder
* pinch of salt

**Matcha Chocolate Coating**

* 1 cup white chocolate chips
* 1 tablespoon matcha powder

&#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Matcha Madeleine**

1. Melt the butter and put it aside to cool to room temperature
2. In a large bowl, pour the eggs, sugar, and matcha powder in and use a hand mixer to beat until the mixture is pale and thick (\~8 minutes)
3. In a small bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt
4. In thirds, carefully fold in the dry mixture from the small bowl, into the whipped eggs and sugar mixture in the large bowl (we want to mix until the ingredients are all combined, but with as little mixing as possible because we want to retrain all the air we whipped into those eggs)
5. Stir 1/2 of the batter from above into the melted butter until that is well combined
6. Then introduce this mixture back into the large bowl and mix together (the batter should be thick and shiny at this point)
7. Chill the batter in the fridge for 15 minutes
8. Preheat the oven to 350F while the batter is cooling
9. Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter and butter each of the madeleine molds in the tray
10. Remove the batter and pour a heaping tablespoon of batter into the madeleine tray
11. Bake the madeleines for 10-12 minutes, or until the tops just spring back after tapping with a finger
12. Remove the madeleines from the tray and allow to cool on a wire rack

**Matcha Chocolate Coating**

1. Pour 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips into a bowl and microwave in 30 second intervals until the chips have melted
2. Once they've melted, pour in the matcha powder and mix
3. Then pour in the other 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and stir together until all the chocolate chips have melted

**Assembly**

1. Pour a tablespoon of the matcha chocolate into the center of each madeleine mold
2. Take a cooled madeleine and press it back into mold, wiggling it around a bit to ensure that the chocolate coats the entire bottom of the madeleine (I usually stop when the chocolate just begins to creep up the sides of the mold)
3. Once this step has been repeated for all the madeleines in the tray, put the tray in the fridge for 30 minutes, or until the chocolate has hardened completely
4. Remove the tray from the fridge and remove the chocolate coated madeleines from the tray

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/noyugl,https://i.redd.it/qdoio20a7f271.jpg,reddit,"Hi guys, this is a twist on the trending wool roll bread that you see on the internet these days (made famous by Apron I think). Anyway I saw their video and was fascinated by it, so I set out to make it, but smaller and filled with chocolate. I also set out to make an eggless version of the bread. I think it turned out pretty well. They were soft and fluffy and the chocolate was not overpowering!  
  
  
Ingredients:  
\- Milk 240 ml  
\- Sugar 40 gms  
\- Yeast 6 gms  
\- Bread Flour 320 gms  
\- Salt 3 gms  
\- Softened Butter 55 gms  
\- Bittersweet Chocolate   

Recipe:  
\- Mix Sugar, Milk & Yeas until the sugar is completely dissolved  
\- Add Bread Flour & Salt  
\- Mix until combined  
\- Add Butter and knead for 10 Minutes (Machine) or 15 Minutes (Hand)  
\- Place in a greased bowl and rest until double in size (45 Minutes - 1 Hour)  
\- Punch the air out  
\- Divide into 8 balls  
\- Roll each ball into a long oblong shape  
\- Cut strands (but don't cut it off) on half of the dough  
\- Add Chocolate (chips, coins, bar) into the uncut end  
\- Roll from the uncut end into a long bun shape (almost like a hot dog bun)  
\- Make sure the strands cover the whole rolled up dough  
\- Pinch the ends and strands so the chocolate does not leak out  
\- Place in a greased baking pan, preferable on that is a cuboid shape  
\- Let rest and proof for 20 min  
\- Bake for 20-25 minutes in 170°-180°C  
\- Brush with butter right after taking it out of oven  
\- Enjoy  


Notes:  
  
\- I think brushing salted butter at the end really brings something to the table, if you don't have salted butter, sprinkle some salt on top of the bread at the end.  
  
\- Make sure the dough passes the window pane test after kneading it, it doesn't need to be super stretchy, just enough so that you can see the outline of your fingers when you touch it.  
  
\- Use bittersweet chocolate, or dark chocolate here. Or if you prefer sweet stuff, I guess milk chocolate is also alright.

1. Put 4 boneless and skinless chicken thighs in the crockpot. Dump a jar of your fav salsa - mine is Mrs. Renfro’s and their mango habanero one is one of the best. I also added some jalapeños and green chilies because I like heat. Cook on high for 3-4 hours and shred chicken once cooked 

2. Lightly fry corn tortillas with canola oil 

3. Put chicken mixture on half the tortilla and top with shredded cheese. Put seam side down on a baking dish 

4. Top with remaining chicken and salsa mix on top of all the tortillas if you have any leftover 

5. Top with more cheese and put it in the oven at 350 for about 10-15 minutes or then broil at the end until cheese is crispy

5. Top with fresh jalapeños. I got a blow torch that I wanted to use so I just lightly torched them a bit 

6. Top with queso fresco 

7. Drizzle the sauce on top. For the sauce - it was a simple blend of cilantro, jalapeños, sour cream, garlic, green chilies, salt, pepper, and EVOO."

**Yield:** 8-inch (20 cm) round pan

**Ingredients:**

**-- Dough --** 

* 260 g (2 cups) all-purpose flour
* 30 g (2½ tbsp) granulated sugar
* 3 g (½ tsp) table salt
* 3 g (1 tsp) instant yeast
* 1 large egg
* 120 g (½ cup) warm milk
* 28 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, room temperature

**-- Custard --** 

* 1 large egg yolk
* 15 g (4 tsp) granulated sugar
* 100 g (¼ cup + 3 tbsp) milk
* 6 g (2 tsp) cornstarch
* 6 g (2 tsp) all-purpose flour
* ½ tsp vanilla extract

**Instructions:** 

**-- Dough --** 

1. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Add egg and warm milk. Mix until it becomes a dough.
2. Transfer the dough onto a work surface. Lightly flour if you find the dough too sticky to handle. Knead for 2 minutes.
3. Wrap and knead the softened butter into the dough until fully incorporated. Knead for 10 minutes or until it becomes smooth, elastic, and not sticky.
4. Shape into a dough ball. Grease it with some vegetable oil in a large bowl. Cover the bowl and place it in a warm area until the dough is doubled in size (about 1 hour).

**-- Custard --**

1. In a saucepan, whisk together egg, sugar, and milk. Sieve in cornstarch and flour. Whisk again to completely dissolve them.
2. Cook the mixture over low heat and whisk it constantly until thickened.
3. Turn off the heat and whisk in vanilla. Transfer custard into a small bowl. Cover its surface with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming. Set aside to cool (refrigerate if you're not using it in the next hour).

**-- Assembly --**

1. Grease an 8-inch (20 cm) round pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray. Line the bottom with parchment paper. 
2. Punch down the dough to release the air inside. Transfer onto a work surface and divide it evenly into 5 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and set them aside for 15 minutes with a cover. 
3. Using a rolling pin, roll out each piece into an elongated shape (about 25cm long). Press down the dough along the sides with your thumbs to keep it from stretching back.
4. Cut out thin strips of dough along the top 2/5 part of the dough (lengthwise), but keep them intact with the remaining part of the dough. The strips will be dangling if we pick up the whole dough. Spread a thin layer of custard filling over the remaining part.
5. Fold 1/4-inch of the dough from 3 edges over the custard. Then start rolling towards the dough strips from the opposite end to form a log. Repeat with the other 4 pieces to get a total of 5 logs.

Flavor Variations

Onions: Add some cut up white or yellow onions to your bowl of sauce and toss well before cooking.

Mushrooms: Steak and mushrooms go hand in hand. Simply add the mushrooms to the bowl to coat in the sauce with a little more oil and air fry them along with the pieces of steak.

Spices: Other spices that go great with soy sauce are garlic, ginger, paprika, cumin, coriander, chili powder, lemon juice, and toasted sesame seeds.

Sauces: Serve the steak bites with a chimichurri sauce, hummus, tzatziki sauce, A1 sauce, barbecue sauce, mustard cream, butter garlic sauce, steak Diane sauce, Worcestershire sauce, or Cajun butter sauce.

Cheese: I can’t get enough of blue cheese crumbles on my steak. Once it’s done cooking, add some blue cheese crumbles to the steak and allow it to slightly melt into the meat. Many famous steakhouses now offer this option and it’s one that I really do like. It add a tangy sharp taste to the steak.

Butter: Toss the air fryer steak in a bowl with butter once it’s done cooking. Not only will this ingredient add moisture, but flavor to it as well.

Garlic: If marinating, add the garlic at the beginning to lock in even more garlic flavor and then cook it according to the recipe directions. If you’re like me and enjoy raw garlic, mince the garlic and toss it in a bowl with a little melted butter to serve over the beef while plating it for dinner."

**For serving:**

* 16 ounces spaghetti

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes until it just begins to soften.

**Sauté the mushrooms:**

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, for 8-10 minutes until they begin to turn deep golden brown all over. Season liberally with salt and pepper.

Melt the butter into the mushrooms and add the capers. Cook for 1–3 minutes more.

**Simmer the sauce:**

Pour in the water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes until it thickens. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the spaghetti:**

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions. Reserve 1/3 cup pasta cooking water. Drain the spaghetti.

Return the piccata sauce to a boil. Add the lemon juice and the pasta cooking water and boil for 1–2 minutes. Add the spaghetti and toss to coat. Turn off the heat.

Roasting the gnocchi gives it an irresistible crispy shell with a fluffy inside. The gnocchi will maintain its crispiness in the sauce for the first serving, but I recommend roasting only the gnocchi you want to eat right away. If you’re eating leftovers, reheat the sauce in the microwave or over the stovetop and roast or air-fry more gnocchi while the sauce reheats.

**What you could add:**

* White beans

**Substitutions:**

* Shallots: Yellow onion
* Cherry tomatoes: 14.5-ounce can of diced tomatoes
* Arugula: Spinach or escarole

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cook time: 55 minutes

Servings: 4

**Ingredients:**

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil, divided
* 16 ounces fresh or frozen gnocchi
* 3 shallots, peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 1 teaspoon sugar, optional
* 2 pints cherry tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons capers, drained
* 2 cups water or vegetable stock
* 5 ounces arugula, a few leaves reserved for garnish
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

Instructions:

**Caramelize the shallots:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallots and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of sugar if you like. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15–20 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent the shallots from burning. Continue cooking until the shallots deepen in color and begin to caramelize. Season with salt and pepper.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Add the capers to the shallots and sprinkle with a few shakes of crushed red pepper if you like. Cook for 1–2 minutes until the capers begin to crisp.
2. Add the cherry tomatoes to the shallots and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook, turning often, for 5–6 minutes or until the tomato skins begin to split.
3. Pour in the water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, mashing the tomatoes as they cook, for 15–20 minutes.

**While the sauce simmers, roast the gnocchi:**

1. Preheat the oven to 450ºF. Arrange the gnocchi in an even layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of neutral oil and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Flip the gnocchi once as it cooks.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Taste the sauce and season with salt, pepper, or more crushed red pepper if you like.
2. Add the arugula to the sauce and cook for 3–4 minutes or until it just begins to wilt.
3. Fold the roasted gnocchi into the sauce and toss gently until coated. Cook for 1-2 minutes more. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the gnocchi between shallow bowls. Garnish with a few fresh arugula leaves. Enjoy!"

1 red chilli, chopped for garnish
4 tbsp red curry paste
1 spring onion, chopped for garnish 
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
400ml coconut milk
Half a lime, for juice
1tsp fish sauce 
100g spinach
1 courgette, chopped

Method:

1. Make the chicken - I like shredded chicken in thai curry so I pop 4 chicken breasts in my instant pot for 10 minutes. You can also slow cook or dice and pan fry to your liking.

2. While the chicken is cooking, slice up the onion and cook in coconut oil until soft ~5 minutes. 

3. Add garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, and stir for 2-3 mins. Add any veg you like here - I went for courgette.

4. Add curry paste, coating veg. Then add coconut milk and stir til smooth. Add fish sauce and juice of half a lime.

5. Added spinach and stir until wilted. Add shredded chicken and ensure liquid coats it. Simmer for 10 minutes.

6. Add chilli and spring onion to garnish. Serve with your chosen accompaniment!"

- 1 cup sweet rice flour or 180g (using koda farms mochiko)  
- 1 cup oat flour or 90g (using @bobsredmill )  
- 1 tbsp baking powder  
- Generous pinch of salt  
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce  
- 1 1/4 cup to 1 3/4 cup milk of choice (see note)  
- 2 tbsp honey or sweetener of choice  
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup wild blueberries (or flavor add ins of choice. I also added sesame seeds for funzies)  
- Half a bean vanilla seeds (optional)  

Directions:  

1. Combine dry ingredients. Then add wet ingredients, stirring to combine. The batter should be pourable however still enough body to coat the back of a spoon.  

2. Cook up pancakes how you normally would. I prefer using a lightly greased cast iron skillet. Heat put a little below medium, cooking for around 2 minutes each side.  

Note:  

- the amount of liquid you use can differ based on what products you use. Measuring things in grams can give you the most accurate thing, but basically add milk as needed to get that pourable batter.  
- You can use water in place of milk, but milk tastes better haha. Although sometimes I ain’t got time for that."

&#x200B;

 

### Ingredients

* 4 pounds chicken wings drumettes and wingettes separated
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* Kosher salt to taste
* Fresh ground black pepper to taste
* ½ cup soy sauce
* ⅓ cup packed brown sugar
* ¼ cup rice wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup
* 1 tablespoon garlic paste or 3 cloves, grated
* 1 tablespoon ginger paste or 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
* 2 tablespoons cold water
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* Sesame seeds to garnish
* 2 scallion finely chopped for garnish

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 F.
2. Line two sheet trays with parchment paper.
3. In a large mixing bowl add half the wings and half the olive oil. Toss to coat. Season well with kosher salt and pepper.
4. Place the wings in a single layer on one of the sheet trays. Ensure there is maximum contact between the wings and the parchment paper. These parts will get crispier.
5. Repeat with the remaining wings and place on the second sheet tray.
6. Position both trays in the oven (side by side on the top shelf if possible, if not you may have to rotate half way through). Cook for 45 minutes.
7. After the wings have gone into the oven combine soy sauce, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar, maple syrup, garlic and ginger in a medium saucepan. Whisk the sauce together until the sugar is dissolved and then turn the heat to medium. Continue to whisk occasionally until it begins to simmer (3-5 minutes).
8. While the sauce is heating up, combine water and cornstarch in a closed container or small bowl. Either shake well or whisk well until a slurry forms. Add the slurry directly to the sauce after it starts to simmer.
9. Whisk continuously for 1 – 1.5 minutes until the sauce thickens and the raw flavor of the cornstarch cooks out. Remove the pan from the heat.
10. Chop the scallions (both green and white parts) finely and set aside.
11. After 45 minutes, take the trays out of the oven and individually flip each wing over and cook an additional 10 minutes until wings are pull apart tender.
12. Place the wings from one tray into a large mixing bowl and toss with half the teriyaki sauce until well coated. Plate the wings and top with half the sesame seeds and chopped scallions.
13. Repeat with the rest of the wings, teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds and chopped scallions.

### Notes

* Ensure the chicken wings are in one single layer, using two sheet trays for four pounds of wings.
* Do not cook the wings with the sauce as it will burn the sauce.
* I find it easiest to make the cornstarch slurry by shaking it in a mason jar.
* If you don’t use all the teriyaki sauce, it freezes well or can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."

For lots more info, including photo instructions, tips, tricks, and variations, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/cinnamon-roll-donuts/](https://maplewoodroad.com/cinnamon-roll-donuts/)

**INGREDIENTS*****Dough For Cinnamon Roll Donuts***

* 1 c warm milk
* 2-½ teaspoon instant or active dry yeast
* ½ c granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* ¼ c butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 c flour, sifted

***Cinnamon Filling***

* ¾ c light brown sugar, packed
* 2 tablespoon cinnamon
* ½ c butter, softened

***Cream Cheese Frosting***

* 6 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1-½ c powdered sugar
* ⅓ c butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

***Additional***

* Canola oil for frying (enough to fill a stovetop pot several inches deep)

**INSTRUCTIONS*****Making The Dough***

1. In a bowl, mix together warm milk and yeast, and then let it sit for several minutes to activate the yeast (while this step isn't really necessary with instant yeast, it doesn't hurt either).
2. Then, add the sugar, melted butter, eggs, salt, and vanilla, and mix well.
3. Finally, add the flour and mix with a dough hook until it forms a ball and pulls away from the sides. The dough will still be quite sticky at this point.
4. Remove the dough from the bowl and, on a lightly floured surface, knead by hand for an additional 5 minutes.

***First Rising Of Dough***

1. Lightly coat a large bowl with oil or cooking spray.
2. Place the dough in the bowl and lightly cover with a clean kitchen towel.
3. Leave in a warm spot for about 1-½ hours or until the dough has doubled in size.

***Adding The Filling***

1. While the dough is proofing, make the filling. In a bowl, simply mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it forms a paste.
2. Once the dough has doubled in size, it's time to roll it out. On a lightly floured surface (or using silicone mats), roll out the dough until it measures approximately 14"" x 20"".
3. Next, spread the filling across the entire surface. I've found that the easiest way to do this is by dropping spoonfuls here and there and then gently spreading it out using a rubber spatula, being careful not to tear the dough.

***Forming The Donuts***

1. Now fold the dough in half by grabbing a short end and carefully pulling it all the way across.
2. Slice off the edges to make clean borders around the dough.
3. Then, slice the dough into 12 equal strips.
4. Twist each of those dough strips several times and pinch the ends tightly together.

***Second Rising Of Dough***

1. Place formed doughnuts on a lined tray and cover lightly with a towel.
2. Let them rest again for about 30 minutes.
3. Note: They will only rise slightly during this time.

***Deep Frying Donuts***

1. Once the donuts are almost finished their second rising, starting heating up the oil on the stove.
2. Pour the canola oil into a pot so that it's several inches deep and attach a candy thermometer to the side.
3. Turn on the stove to medium heat. Our goal here is for the oil to reach between 350℉ and 375℉, the optional temperature range for deep frying. This will take at least 15 minutes. Make sure the oil temperature stabilizes within this range.
4. Once your oil has reached the proper temperature, it's time to fry the donuts!
5. Using a stainless steel spider, gently place one donut at a time into the oil.
6. Let the donut fry for 40 seconds, then gently turn it over and let the second side cook for 20 seconds.
7. Using a spider or tongs, quickly but carefully remove from the pot and place on a wire cooling rack.

***Cream Cheese Frosting***

1. Place softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl.
2. If using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment. Otherwise, mix well with a spoon until smooth.
3. Once the donuts have cooled, drizzle or spread the frosting over them in any beautiful way you wish.
4. Enjoy!"

**Ingredients:**

* 16 ounces gnocchi
* 1 pound large shrimp, peeled, tails left on or removed depending on preference
* 1 tablespoon garlic pepper (or use a mix of salt, garlic powder, and black pepper)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 tablespoon your favorite hot honey (I used a citrus/chile marmalade)
* 1 heaping tablespoon flour
* 1 cup chicken broth or water
* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Red pepper flakes, optional, to taste
* 1 lemon, juiced with 1/2 teaspoon zest
* 1/3 cup loosely packed fresh parsley, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the gnocchi:**

1. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and cook until they float to the top. Drain and rinse thoroughly with water to keep them from sticking.

**Fry the shrimp:**

1. Pat the shrimp dry and season them with garlic pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add 2 tablespoons butter. As soon as the butter is melted and bubbly, add the shrimp and arrange them into an even layer. Fry without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook 1–2 minutes more. Do not overcook! It’s alright if the shrimp aren’t all perfectly opaque. Transfer them to a large bowl.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into the pot. Adjust the heat to medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 8–10 minutes until it begins to brown around the edges and soften completely.
2. Add the hot honey and stir to coat the onions. Add the flour and stir to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Slowly stir in the broth or water. Continue stirring until completely smooth. Once the liquid begins to bubble, stir in the cream and parmesan. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like. Simmer for 5 minutes.

**Finish the shrimp and gnocchi:**

1. Stir in the lemon juice and zest and the fresh parsley. Add the shrimp and gnocchi and let bubble in the sauce for 5 minutes just to warm the gnocchi and shrimp. Taste and season once more.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the shrimp and gnocchi into shallow bowls. Garnish with more parsley if you like. Enjoy!"

**A quick tip:**

Typically, you need to only boil pearl onions for 2 minutes. I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I don't have to sauté them quite as long since you're holding the duck. BUT! If you don't mind dirtying another skillet, feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.

Seared duck breast:

* 1 duck breast (1 pound)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Mushrooms and pearl onions:

* 8 ounces gold or white pearl onions
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat
* 3 sprigs thyme
* 4 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley, plus more for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

Sweet potato puree:

* 2 sweet potatoes, about 1 pound, peeled and cubed
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ cup whole milk plus more, if needed
* 2 tablespoons sour cream
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

Parboil and peel the pearl onions:

1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.
2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.

Cook the sweet potatoes:

1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.
2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.
3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.
4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.

Cook the duck:

1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in ⅛-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.
2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.
3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.
4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6–8 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.
5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130ºF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135ºF.
6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.

Fry the mushrooms and onions:

1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.
2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.
4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and sauté for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.

To serve:

1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.
2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like. Enjoy!"

**Total ingredients needed**

* 225 g Butter
* 420 g White sugar
* 8 g Vanilla extract
* 120 g Pumpkin puree
* 1 x Egg (large)
* 330 g All-purpose flour
* 7 g Baking powder
* 3 g Salt
* 12 g Pumpkin spice
* -----------
* This recipe yields about 24 medium or 36 small sized soft pumpkin snickerdoodles.
* Tip: If you can’t buy canned pumpkin puree, you can easily make it on your own by baking, cooking or microwaving pumpkin pieces until they are soft and then blend them to a puree.

**1. Mix**

* 225 g Butter (softened)
* 300 g White sugar
* 4 g Vanilla extract
* 120 g Pumpkin puree
* 1 x Egg (large)
* 330 g All-purpose flour
* 3 g Salt
* 7 g Baking powder
* 2 g Pumpkin spice
* -----------
* Sift all the dry ingredients together in a second bowl and stir until combined
* Carefully add them to the previous dough step by step while mixing further on low speed until just combined to avoid overmixing
* The dough should be very soft but still thick
* We used a stand mixer to mix the dough, but you can also use a hand mixer
* Beat the softened butter together with the white sugar in a large bowl for about 1 minute
* Afterwards, add the vanilla extract and pumpkin puree and mix for 2 minutes until combined
* Then add the egg and also mix until fully incorporated

**2. Rest**

* Store the pumpkin snickerdoodles dough sealed in the fridge at 4-6°C (39,2-42,8°F) for 2 hours

**3. Shape**

* ~120 g White sugar
* 10 g Pumpkin spice
* -----------
* Take a small bowl, fill it with white sugar and and pumpkin spice and stir until combined
* Take 2 baking plates and cover them with parchment paper
* Use a cookie scoop or tablespoon to get some dough out of the bowl to have roughly the same amount of dough for every cookie
* Roll the dough with your hands into a ball
* Coat it with the pumpkin spice sugar mixture on all sides by rolling it around in the bowl you previously set aside
* Place the coated dough balls next to each other on the baking plate (3 rows with 4 cookies per row)
* I went for 12 pumpkin snickerdoodles per baking plate so I had 24 in total

**4. Bake**

* Preheat oven to 175°C (347°F) with the circulating heat function
* Put one baking plate in the middle rack of the oven and bake for a total of 10 minutes or until the edges start getting brown
* After baking, take the pumpkin snickerdoodles out
* Info: I baked one batch with the circulating heat function and one with the upper and lower heat function. By using the upper and lower heat function, the dough diverged too much. If your oven only has the upper and lower heat function, you should bake at about 190°C (374°F).

**5. Serve**

* Let your soft pumpkin snickerdoodles rest on the baking plate they were baked on for 5 minutes
* Afterwards transfer them, including the parchment paper, to a wire cooling rack for further cooling for at least 15 minutes to set"

Remade it for my cooking site and have to say it’s more flavorful than I had back in the day. Original recipe and notes can be found [here](https://girlwiththeironcast.com/chicken-pot-pie/) 

**INGREDIENTS**
* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into bite size cubes

* 2 tbsp olive oil

* 2 tsp of adobo seasoning for chicken or can substitute with desired seasoning

* 2 medium carrots, peeled & diced (1 cup)

* 3/4 lb yukon gold potatoes, peeled & diced (2 cups)

* 2 cloves garlic, minced (1 tbsp)

* 3 tbsp unsalted butter

* 1 tbsp better than bouillon paste or 1 chicken bouillon cube

* 1 tsp dried thyme

* 1/4 tsp + 1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper

* 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

* 3/4 cup low sodium chicken broth

* 1/2 cup 2% milk

* 1/3 cup all purpose flour

* 1/2 cup frozen peas

* 2 pre-made pie crusts, room temperature

* 1 egg, whisked + 1 tbsp water for egg wash

**INSTRUCTIONS**

* Preheat oven to 375 degrees F

* In a large cast iron (or regular skillet) over medium high heat, add 2 tbsp of olive oil and the chicken. Add seasoning and brown chicken till fully cooked through. Remove from skillet and set aside.

* Lower the heat to medium, add 3 tbsp of butter, carrots, potatoes, garlic, thyme, 1/4 tsp black pepper and bouillon paste. Sauté for about 8 minutes until carrots and potatoes begin to soften (you can cover with foil/lid to assist). Add back into the skillet the chicken, add the frozen peas, and fresh parsley, stir to combine everything.

* Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and carefully mix. Once flour is mixed in, add the milk and the chicken broth and carefully mix all the ingredients. Bring to a soft boil, about 5 minutes. Once the mixture reaches a boil, lower the heat to simmer and gently stir until sauce thickens, 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat.

* In a 9 inch pie dish, spray some non-stick cooking spray, and gently roll your pie crust into the pie dish. Gently press the dough into the dish to ensure it’s evenly spread and reaching to the ends of the pie dish (you may trim the ends hanging off if needed). Add the pie filling to the dish. Take your second pie dough and carefully roll it over the filling. Using a fork or your fingers, press the edges of the pie dough down so it seals the edges. 

* In a small bowl whisk the egg and 1 tbsp of water. Using a brush, carefully brush the entire top of the pie dough with the egg wash. Using a knife, cut a “+” in the middle of the pie as a vent to allow the steam to escape. Sprinkle a little salt and fresh ground pepper on top of the dough. 
* Bake for 30-35 minutes until the pie crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving."

INGREDIENTS  
FOR THE COOKIES:  


* ½ cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
* 3 ounces/85 grams cream cheese, at room temperature
* 1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 ¼ cups/285 grams cake flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* Sprinkles, for garnish

FOR THE FROSTING:  


* 4 tbsp seedless raspberry jam
* ½ cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
* 1 cups/130 grams confectioners’ sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch of kosher salt

PREPARATION  
Make the cookies:

1. In a large bowl, mix together the butter, cream cheese, sugar and salt until smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and whisk to incorporate some air and to dissolve the sugar crystals, about 1 minute.
2. Stir in the flour and baking powder until just incorporated.
3. Heat oven to 350 degrees and line two rimmed sheet pans with parchment paper. Using two spoons or a cookie scooper, plop out 2-tablespoon/50-gram rounds spaced a couple of inches apart. (You should get about 7 to 8 cookies per sheet pan.) Place the sheet pans in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until the dough is no longer sticky and easier to handle.
4. While the dough chills, make the frosting:In a bowl, add butter, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, raspberry jam and salt and, with an electric hand mixer, mix until the butter absorbs the sugar and gets fluffy. Cover and set aside.
5. Remove the sheet pans from the freezer. Roll the chilled dough into even balls and flatten them slightly with your fingers so they’re about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high. Bake the cookies for 13 to 15 minutes, rotating the pans and switching racks halfway through, or until they no longer look wet on top, are still light in color and spring back to the touch. They will puff up and crack slightly. Let cool completely on the sheet pan. (They will continue to cook as they sit.)
6. Using a butter knife or offset spatula, frost each cooled cookie with the raspberry frosting and adorn with the sprinkles

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1eqa841,https://i.redd.it/w2wtqk9gn7id1.jpeg,reddit,"# Ingredients

* 300g beef brisket
* 1000g ivory white radish
* 50g cilantro
* 25g dried tangerine peel
* 25g fresh ginger
* 2500g water
* 2g salt

 

 

# Directions

1. Wash the beef brisket and cut into 2.5 cm cubes. Clean the cilantro and chop finely. Peel the white radish and cut into 3 cm rolling knife cuts.
2. Place a frying pan on the stove, fill with water up to 70%, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the beef brisket and cook through, skimming off any foam. Once cooked, remove the brisket and rinse it clean.
3. Set a soup pot on the stove, add water, ginger, dried tangerine peel, and the beef brisket. Bring to a boil over high heat, then switch to low heat and cover, simmering slowly for about 2 hours until the beef is tender. Then add the radish pieces and continue to stew until the radish is thoroughly cooked and soft.
4. Season with salt, and transfer to a soup bowl. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro.

 

# Tips

* The cutting of the beef should be uniform in size, and the radish pieces should not be too large to ensure they are easy to eat and should not be too small to ensure they do not fall apart.
* The essence of stewing is to cook the ingredients until they are tender but still hold their shape. Key elements include managing the cooking time, heat, texture of the ingredients, and the order in which they are added."

* Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve ⅓ cup of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

## Finish the pasta:

* Add the basil and baby beet greens to the sauce and cook until wilted. Add the reserved pasta cooking water and bring to a boil. Add the pasta and toss to coat until the sauce sticks to the pasta—taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

## To serve:

* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with basil leaves and freshly grated parmesan, if you like. Enjoy!

2. We draw 4 equal circles on baking paper (I have 12 cm) and spread our mass evenly. We send it to a preheated 180 ° oven for 20 minutes.
 
3. For the cream, mix soft cottage cheese with honey. Soak the gelatin in water for 20 minutes. Then put it in a water bath until completely dissolved. After that, gelatin can be added to the curd.
 
4. We smear our cakes with the curd mass, then apply the cream on top and on the sides. Sprinkle with almond petals. We draw a chocolate cobweb. First we apply spirals with chocolate, then we draw straight lines from the center to make a spider web.

**Enjoy the recipe and join** r/UnitedCuisines, **where you can also find our YouTube show!**

INGREDIENTS:

\- Yufka pastry leaves (no fat phyllo sheets) \[ 7 oz / 200 g\] (cut in triangles)

\- a handful flat Italian parsley

\- soft brine cheese (e.g. Feta) \[6 oz / 180 g\]

\- vegetable oil \[1 cup / 250 ml\]

\- 1 fresh egg (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Chop the parsley and, in a big enough bowl, mix with the crumbled cheese/feta. In addition, you can add a beaten egg (optional), which mostly acts as a binding agent
2. Before you start rolling your Boreks, keep a small bowl of water close by, which will help so seal your pastry. Grab a triangle, place it in front of you, the short side facing towards you and the tip of the long sides away from you. And spread a tablespoon of your cheese filling along the short side. Leave around half an inch, or 1-2 cm, border right and left, which you fold, before you start rolling your cigar. Apply a enough pressure to keep the folded corners of the pastry sheets in when rolling, but don't be too firm, otherwise, you will squeeze out the cheese filling
3. To seal your cigar börek, just dip the tip of the sheet in water, finish the rolling process and the sheet will stick to itself. Proceed and roll as many Cigara Böreks as possible (10-20, depending on the triangles' size and how much filling you grant one Borek)
4. Pour the vegetable oil in a pan and heat it up over medium high till its temperature reaches 350°F or 180°C. Keep a second plate, covered with kitchen towel, ready, on which you'll drain your fried rolls
5. Fry rolls till they turn strongly golden, almost brown. Don't overcrowd the pan and leave a little space between them. Which you should turn upside down a few times and remove from the oil in time, before they darken too much. It took us only 1-3 minutes in total per roll
6. Shortly drain on kitchen towel, before being piled up on your serving plate
7. Enjoy!"

**Ingredients:**

**Tortillas:**

- 200g nixtamalized corn flour

- 1 tsp salt

- 300ml warm water

**Jackfruit:**

- 1 can (560g) canned green jackfruit, drained, cut into smaller pieces

- 1 tsp smoked paprika

- 1 tsp cumin, ground 

- 1/2 tsp salt

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil

- 1 large white onion, diced

- 3 garlic cloves, minced

- 1 can (400g) canned, chopped tomatoes

- 400ml veggie stock

- 1 tsp sugar

**Garnish:**

- Avocado

- Pickled red onions

- Cilantro

- Lime juice

- Hot sauce

**Preparation:**

1. For the tortillas: mix flour with salt, then add the water and combine well. Rest for at least 30 minutes. Divide into balls of around 40-50g. 

2. Put each ball between 2 sheets of plastic wrap (or just use a ziplock cut into 2 pieces like I did), and press them in a tortilla press (which I didn’t have) or just use a rolling pin. They should be very thin.

3. Heat up a skillet until very hot and cook the tortillas for around a minute on each side. Keep them wrapped in a towel until ready to use so they keep warm and don’t dry out. 

4. For the jackfruit: start by sautéing the white onion with some vegetable oil. After 3-4 minutes add the garlic. After a minute - add the paprika, cumin and salt. Cook for another 30 seconds, then add the jackfruit, tomatoes and stock along with some sugar.

5. Simmer for 15 minutes, then smash the jackfruit with a potato masher. Cook for another 15 minutes until the liquid reduces and you get a pulled pork consistency. 

6. Garnish with avocado slices, pickled red onion, cilantro lime juice, and optionally some hot sauce. I just blended a can of chipotles in adobo until smooth. 

Didn’t want to include this in the recipe per se, but for a quick pickled onion - just slice an onion, add the juice of half a lime, some salt and sugar, mix well and let sit for 30 minutes or so. 

You could surely use store bought tortillas - haven’t found any that I like where I live, so I just prefer to make my own. 

Enjoy!

Making the Cocoa Graham Cracker Crust

Ingredients

- 6 full sheets of Graham crackers

- 2 tbsp granulated sugar (25 g)

- 2 tbsp cocoa powder (14 g)

- 2 1/2 tbsp butter, melted (35 g)

Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350° F (180° C).

2. Place your Graham crackers in a food processor and grind them into fine crumbs. You should be left with about 3/4 cup (90 g) of crumbs.

3. Add in sugar and cocoa powder to the food processor and pulse to incorporate.

4. Lastly add in your melted butter and pulse until the butter is distributed evenly. Mixture will be sandy but will hold together once baked.

5. In an un-greased 7-inch springform pan, pour in your Graham cracker mixture. Press the mixture into an even layer to cover the entire base so that everything stays compacted.

6. Bake crust in oven for 10 minutes. Once crust is baked, take out of the oven and let cool slightly in the springform pan as you make the filling. Leave oven at 350° F (180° C).

Making the Cheesecake Filling

Ingredients

- two 8-oz bricks of cream cheese, softened to room temperature (about 452 g total)

- 1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 g)

- 1/2 cup plain or vanilla greek yogurt, room temperature (130 g)

- 1 tsp vanilla extract

- 2 medium eggs, room temperature

- 2 1/2 ounces of dark chocolate, melted (70 g)

Directions

1. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese with the sugar on medium speed until mixture is smooth and creamy, about 30-60 seconds.

2. Beat in Greek yogurt and vanilla until combined and smooth. As you proceed to add in each ingredient, scrape down the sides of the bowl in between mixes to ensure a smooth, homogenous filling.

3. On low speed, beat in your eggs, one at a time until just incorporated. Once the last egg is just blended in, stop the mixer. Over-mixing the filling will lead to cracks.

4. Pour about half the filling into a separate bowl. Fold in your melted chocolate into one of your bowls of filling. The other bowl of filling you will leave vanilla.

5. Pour your chocolate cheesecake filling into your springform pan. Use a spatula to smooth the filling into an even layer on top of your crust.

6. Carefully pour your vanilla cheesecake filling into the springform pan, making sure to pour slowly and evenly on top of the chocolate layer so the two layers stay distinct. Gently smooth out the top of the vanilla layer with a spatula or spoon.

7. Place your springform pan inside a slightly larger 8-inch round cake pan. Because we will bake the cheesecake in a water-bath, the larger cake pan will keep water from seeping into the springform pan and ruining the cheesecake.

8. To make the water-bath, take your cake pan (with the springform pan still inside) and place it in a deep roasting pan or baking tray. Carefully pour boiling water into the large roasting pan so it fills up an inch up the sides and place into your oven. Be sure no water spills into the cheesecake.

9. Bake cheesecake for 45-50 minutes, or until the center of the cheesecake has a slight wobble when you gently shake the pan. Turn off the oven. Leave your cheesecake in the oven with the door open for 20 minutes.

10. Take springform pan out from the oven and let cool down at room temperature, about another 20 minute.

11. Cover and place in the fridge for about 4 hours to chill and set up as your prepare the toppings.

Making the Salted Caramel Sauce

Ingredients

- 1/4 cup granulated sugar (50 g)

- 2 tbsp heavy cream

- 1 1/2 tbsp butter

- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract

- Pinch of salt

Directions

1. In a saucepan over medium heat, heat sugar until melted. Stir constantly with a rubber spatula so sugar cooks evenly. Once melted, continue to stir and cook sugar until it turns copper colored.

2. Take off the heat and add in heavy cream and butter. Stir until everything is melted and combined.

3. Lastly stir in your vanilla and salt. Pour caramel into a small bowl to thicken and cool to room temperature.

Assembly:

Components

- melted dark chocolate for drizzling

- handful of chopped, toasted pecans

- salted caramel sauce and cheesecake you made earlier

- flaky sea salt

- 2 teaspoons of Salt
- 1 teaspoon of  Black Pepper
- 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper
- 1 teaspoon of Paprika
- 1 teaspoon of Garlic Powder
- 1 teaspoon of Onion Powder
- 1 teaspoon of Red Pepper Flakes
- 1 teaspoon of Dried Oregano

LEMON BUTTER SAUCE
- 2 to 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- 1 lemon juiced
- 1 tablespoon of garlic paste 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Pick your desired cut of fish. I chose 6 oz of cod filets. Rinse them in white vinegar and lemon, to remove any fishy smell.

Apply your cajun/blackening seasoning (to your desired taste or level)and massage well. Set aside for 10 minutes for a quick marinade. Cajun seasoning recipe is large enough for 4-5 servings of fish. 

When ready, sear your filets on medium-high heat. Place the filet down & don't move it. Allow it to build a crust (approx. for 4 minutes) then flip to other side. Splash some water into your pan and cover. The steam will finish cooking your filets, leaving them juicy and flaky. 

Remove filets and begin building your butter sauce in the same pan. Don't clean your pan before this step. Any leftover blackened bits will flavor your sauce. Deglaze your pan with butter, garlic and lemon juice. Whisk until your sauce is glossy. Season to taste and serve over your cod.

Pair your cod filets with your favorite side dish, I chose garlic mashed potatoes but creamy polenta or risotto would work too.

Enjoy!

**Broth:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* 2–3 jalapeños, trimmed and halved
* 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
* 4 pounds chicken, whole or cut up
* 8–10 cups water
* Salt

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 2 bell peppers, trimmed, seeded, and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
* 10-ounce can diced tomatoes and habaneros (optional)
* 15-ounce can black beans, drained
* 15-ounce can red enchilada sauce
* 4 ounces softened cream cheese, optional
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Cilantro, cotija or grated cheese, avocado, lime wedges, minced red onion, or sliced serrano pepper

**Prepare the broth:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil over high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the onion and jalapeños and cook for 2–3 minutes until they begin to char. Add the garlic, cut side down, for 1 minute until it begins to brown.
2. Place the chicken on top and pour over 8–10 cups of water, enough to completely submerge the chicken. Season with a teaspoon or two of salt. It will cook down and become quite salty, so there is no need to go too heavy with it.
3. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Check the broth occasionally and skim off any foam or scum that floats to the top.
4. After 1 hour, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer it to a bowl.

**Finish the broth and shred the chicken:**

1. Turn the heat to medium or medium-high. You want it hot enough to maintain a rapid simmer but not boil vigorously. Simmer rapidly for 20 minutes.
2. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids.
3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat from the bones and add it to the bowl of broth.
4. Carefully wipe out the pot with a damp cloth and return the pot to the stovetop.

**Prepare the soup:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil over medium-high heat in the pot. Add the diced onion and peppers and cook, occasionally stirring, for 5–7 minutes. Season lightly with salt.
2. Melt the butter into the onion and peppers. Once bubbly, add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne powder, and paprika. Toss to coat and sizzle the spices in the butter for about 1 minute.
3. Pour in the reserved broth and shredded chicken. Next, pour in the diced tomatoes, black beans, and enchilada sauce cans. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and season to your preferences.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Stir in the softened cream cheese if using. Continue cooking until it’s completely melted into the broth.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!"

Luckily I found this beautiful Chicken of the woods mushroom growing on an old oak tree. I carefully picked a few younger parts suitable for frying and happily headed back home. Couldn't resist to also pick some of the stinging nettles that were growing nearby. This delicious soup is a result of my foraging adventure.

Makes 4 portions

**Ingredients:**

* 200g (7oz) Chicken of the Wood mushroom (youngest parts further from the attachment side)
* 10g (0.33oz) of Stinging Nettle (washed youngest parts, before flowering)
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 50g (1.7oz) celery, diced
* 50g (1.7oz) leek, diced
* 1 small carrot, diced
* 300g (10.6oz) of broccoli chopped
* 3 garlic cloves
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1tbsp of sweet soy sauce (half the amount if using standard soy sauce)
* 1tbsp of butter
* 1L (1quart) of vegetable stock
* 1tbsp of thick yoghurt or sour cream plus extra for garnish
* black pepper to taste

**Method:**

1. Begin by preparing the mushroom, remember to use younger parts as the old ones tend to be woodier in texture and sour in flavour. Wash the mushroom from the forest contaminants and slice it to thin pieces. Boil mushroom in salted water for about 10 minutes as this will help to soften its texture. When cooked remove from water and place on a plate for later use.
2. To prepare the soup, on medium heat in a medium pot, fry diced onion. celery, carrot and garlic. When coloured add chopped broccoli and cook for another 2 minutes. Cover everything with 1L (1quart) of vegetable stock (there should be enough liquid to cover all the vegetables so you may add a bit more). Simmer the soup covered with a lid for about 20 minutes.
3. In the meantime, you can prepare some roasted nettle leaves to decorate your delicious soup. Place the frying pan on medium heat and add the smallest nettle leaves that you prepared, after a few seconds, they should start to dry out, turn around for another couple seconds, remove from the pan ready to be used later.
4. Now we can fry the mushroom, pan fry on medium heat with 1tbsp of olive oil. This step takes around 5-8 minutes, next glaze with 1tbsp of sweet soy sauce to coat and remove, place under tinfoil cover to prevent drying out.
5. When time is up for the soup, blend it with a blender and add stinging nettles, blend again (you want to see some parts of the nettle in the soup)
6. Now add 1tbsp of yoghurt or sour cream (mix it first with one ladle of the soup and then pour in) then mix in 1tbsp of butter.
7. Serve the soup with chicken of the woods stacked in the middle, garnish with roasted nettle leaves, black pepper and some yoghurt. I also had some sourdough bread with it.

Notes:

* Chicken of the woods mushroom prepared that way can be used for other recipes to substitute vegetarian protein, amazing in stir-frys, stews or as a snack.
* To pick stinging nettles without hurting your fingers, use gloves and scissors.   Wash in a bowl of cold water and dry with a paper towel.
* Try to avoid Chicken of the Woods that grow on Yew trees as there are some statements of possible toxicity. Before eating any new mushrooms make sure it is the right one and consume a little amount first to see if there is any allergic reaction.

- 300g arborio
- Handful parsley
- 50g grated parmesan
- Dried thyme
- 50g butter
- Salt & pepper
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2  chicken stock (1.5 litres)
- 250-500 grams pack white mushrooms
- 1 x 175ml glass white wine

Start off with sweating out and slightly browning the onions. Then once that is done, add in mushrooms and 50 grams of butter, this might take a while so cook them down until their wilted and browned. After, put in your garlic, thyme, salt and pepper and stir well until it slightly caramelised. 

In the video instructions I added in the white wine and rice at the same time - I know this isn’t the traditional method, and that you’re supposed to toast the rice first and then add the wine, but I was a little short on time and I find that doing it this wine it tastes just as good. 

So go ahead and toast your rice and cook out the alcohol from the wine, then start ladling in your chicken stock. 

I ladled in two spoonfuls at a time in intervals of 3-4 minutes until the liquid has almost completely reduced. Do this until you’ve used all your stock or until your rice has become soft and slightly al denté. 

Afterwards, turn off the heat and add in 50 grams of grated parmesan and a handful of finely chopped parsley. 

Then you’re done!"

INGREDIENTS

- 1 cup warm apple cider
- 4 scoops vanilla ice cream or gelato

INSTRUCTIONS

Heat 1 cup of apple cider on either the stovetop or microwave until just warmed through. Meanwhile, place 2 scoops of ice cream or gelato in each coffee mug. Pour ½ cup of warm cider in each mug over the ice cream and serve immediately."

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/nutella-babka/](https://maplewoodroad.com/nutella-babka/)

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Babka Dough***

* ¾ c whole milk, warm
* ⅓ c granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 2 large eggs
* 3 c all purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 6 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into small cubes

***Nutella Filling***

* 1-¼ c Nutella chocolate hazelnut spread
* ¼ c unsalted butter, melted
* ¾ c finely chopped hazelnuts

***Simple Syrup***

* ½ c granulated sugar
* ½ c water  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. The first step is to let the yeast bloom for a few minutes while you gather the rest of your ingredients.
2. Stir together warm milk, sugar, vanilla, and yeast. Let sit for about 5 minutes.
3. Next, using a dough hook attachment, add the flour, salt, and eggs, and mix again at low speed.
4. Keeping the dough hook on low speed, add the butter a few cubes at a time, and then let it continue kneading on the same speed for 5 minutes. During this time, the dough will pull together nicely and form into a sticky dough.
5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to proof for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.
6. Once the dough has doubled in size, roll it out on a lightly floured surface, until it measures approximately 14"" x 16"".
7. Cut the edges to make a rectangle shape (I like to use a pizza cutter to easily make smooth, straight lines).
8. Stir together the Nutella and melted butter.
9. Very gently spread the Nutella and butter mixture over the dough using a rubber spatula, being careful not to tear the dough, then sprinkle finely chopped hazelnuts over the spread.
10. Starting on a long side, tightly roll up the dough into a log shape.
11. Then, with the seam side facing down, slice the roll in half lengthwise, with the filling side facing up.
12. Twist the two sides and pinch the ends together to form a long braided loaf.
13. Place in a parchment lined 9"" loaf pan.
14. Lightly cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to let it rise again for 2 hours.
15. Preheat oven to 350℉.
16. Remove the plastic wrap from your loaf pan and bake the bakba on the middle rack of your oven for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the bread comes out clean.
17. While the babka is baking, make the simple syrup.
18. Simply stir together sugar and water and simmer on the stove for a few minutes until the sugar has completely dissolved. Then remove from heat and let cool.
19. Once the babka has finished baking but while it's still warm and in the lined loaf pan, brush the simple syrup over the top. Yes, all of it!
20. Let the babka soak up all the syrup and cool completely before removing from the pan.
21. Serve and enjoy!"

* 6 Egg Whites
* 2 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 100 mg Milk chocolate Melted and cooled slightly

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
   
***Moist Chocolate Cake***

1. Preheat your oven to 350F. Oil and line three 6” cake pans, with parchment paper rounds.
2. In large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, espresso powder, salt, baking soda and baking powder. 
3. Sift cocoa powder into flour mixture.  
To the flour mixture, directly add egg, vegetable oil, vanilla, and milk. Mix until well incorporated and mixture is a thick, glossy, dark brown paste.
4. Add boiling water to the mixture (slowly).
5. Gently stir until the mixture transitions from a paste consistency to a thin liquid consistency.
6. Pour 1/3 of cake batter into each cake pan.  
7. Bake cakes for 25-27 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean.  
8. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

***Rich Chocolate Ganache***

1. Place chopped semisweet chocolate in a medium sized bowl. Add hot cream.
2. Let stand for 5 minutes, without mixing.
3. After 5 minutes, whisk mixture until homogenous (it will initially look as though it is not coming together, keep going! It will become smooth and glossy)
4. Ganache should be pourable consistency while not too liquid (If not quite the right consistency, let bowl refrigerate for 5-10 mins)  


***Toasted Graham Cracker Crumbs***

1. Preheat oven to 350F. In a food processor, pulse gram crackers until a fine crumb forms (this can also in a ziplock bag, crushing gram crackers with a rolling pin).
2. Once crumb forms, add sugar, cinnamon, and melted butter. Mix with spoon to incorporate.
3. Place wet graham cracker crumb mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
4. Bake at 350F (325F convection bake) for 10-15 mins, until slightly golden. Let cool completely.
5. Milk Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream
6. Start by cleaning the bowl of an electric stand mixer thoroughly to ensure all oily debris has been removed! Dry bowl completely.
7. Separate egg whites from egg yolks. Add egg whites one by one to the clean electric mixer bowl. Add sugar. Whisk egg whites with sugar.
8. Place bowl over a saucepan filled with no no more than 2 inches of water, simmering over medium heat (Note: this step creates a double boiler – the bowl should not be touching the water, it is the steam that will heat the egg whites)
9. Whisk sugar and egg whites, until mixture is frothy and sugar has dissolved (approximately 5 minutes). You can either feel the texture between your fingers at this point to ensure you can no longer feel sugar grains or check temperature with a candy thermometer (when ready, the mixture will be at 160F).
10. Return stand mixer bowl with egg white mixture to stand mixer. Reattach whisk and beat on medium-high speed. Beat until glossy, stiff, peaks form and mixture is no longer warm to the touch (\~10-15 minutes). I find you can speed up this process by placing ice packs on the sides of the base of the bowl as the mixer is running (this will more quickly cool the base)
11. At this time, you can melt chocolate in a small bowl in the microwave (10-15s increments, stirring after each interval). Once melted, set aside.
12. Once bowl and meringue have cooled, replace whisk attachment with a paddle attachment and begin adding butter (Note: Butter should be \~1 hour outside of fridge and still somewhat cool to the touch). Add 1 tablespoon of butter at a time, waiting until fully incorporated before adding more.
13. Once all butter has been added, add vanilla extract, salt, and melted chocolate. Turn mixer speed down to medium and continue to beat.
14. This Swiss Meringue Buttercream is finished when it is thick, creamy, and silky smooth. It will hold its shape very well. Continue to beat for another 3-5 minutes on low to remove air bubbles.

***Assembly***

1. Remove parchment paper backing from the first 6"" cake round.
2. Pipe a ring of the Milk Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream around the rim of the cake round.
3. Add chocolate ganache to the centre and spread even layer. Pipe marshmallow fluff on top of the ganache. Finish layer with a generous sprinkle of toasted graham cracker crumbs. Add 2nd cake layer.
4. Repeat steps 2-3. Add third and final cake layer to the top. Frost with remaining Swiss Meringue Buttercream.
5. Refrigerate cake for 30 minutes
6. Once frosting is cool to the touch, dollop sides of cake with marshmallow fluff. Continue to add marshmallow fluff to the top of the cake. Torch marshmallow fluff with a kitchen torch until desired toasted appearance is created. Return cake to the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
7. Finish cake by adding chopped chocolate, graham cracker crumbs, and mini marshmallows to the top."

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9×13 inch pan.
2. Chop 14 oz walnuts and toss with 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Set aside.
3. Unroll package of phyllo dough. You might need to trim the edges to fit your pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.
4. Sprinkle a handful of the walnut/cinnamon mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, and walnut mixture again, layering as you go. The final top layer should be about 6 – 8 sheets deep.
5. Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then cut across, and then make the diagonal cuts. It helps to rinse knife and finger every couple of cuts. That keeps the knife and your fingers from sticking to the top layer.
6. Bake for about 40-50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.
7. Make syrup while baklava is baking. Heat 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water until sugar is melted. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and 1/2 cup of honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently and keeping eye on pot to make sure it doesn’t boil over.
8. Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. You won’t need all of the sauce. Let cool. Serve in cupcake papers. Store it in airtight containers so that it retains its crispiness."

* .5 ounces dry porcini mushrooms
* 1 cup boiling water
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 leek, white and light green part only; trimmed, scrubbed thoroughly, and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 cup arborio rice
* 5–6 cups warm water or vegetable stock, more or less as needed
* 4 ounces Taleggio cheese, rind removed
* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons finely minced parsley
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Sweet pea tendrils, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the porcini mushrooms:**

1. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over the mushrooms and soak for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water and finely chop them. Reserve the soaking liquid for the risotto.

**Fry the cremini mushrooms:**

1. Place a large pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Add the sliced cremini mushrooms to the dry pot and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water and begin to dry out.
2. Once all the liquid evaporates from the pot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 8–10 minutes more, turning regularly, until browned and crisp. Season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the leek:**

1. Add the leek and chopped porcini mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until the leek softens.

**Toast the rice:**

1. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the rice and cook for 2–3 minutes until it begins to toast. Season with salt and pepper.

**Begin adding liquid:**

1. Add the porcini soaking liquid and stir to incorporate and lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring periodically until the rice absorbs all the liquid.
2. Add warm water or vegetable stock in ladleful increments, stirring after each addition and adding more liquid once the rice absorbs what’s in the pot. Stir occasionally, but not constantly. You may need to adjust the heat between medium and medium-low to prevent the risotto from sticking.
3. After 20–25 minutes, the rice should be tender and the liquid creamy. You may need 4–5 cups of liquid, give or take. Taste and add more salt and pepper.

**Finish the risotto:**

1. Turn the heat to low. Add the Taleggio cheese and stir to incorporate. Continue stirring until the cheese melts completely. Add the Parmesan cheese, minced parsley, and lemon juice. Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season, and let the risotto stand for 5 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the risotto into a large serving bowl. Garnish with sweet pea tendrils and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if you like. Enjoy!"

1. In a bowl, add all purpose flour, instant yeast, salt, sugar and egg+ milk mixture. Mix well together. You just need to mix them well together at this step. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 1 hour.
2. After 1 hour, add 40g of room temperature unsalted butter and knead the dough until it becomes smooth. I kneaded dough by hands for about 13 minutes to get it smooth. Cover the bowl and let the dough proof for another 1 hour in a warm spot. I put into the oven without turning it on.
3. In the meantime, heat 1 tbsp of oil and add 4 sausages. After they are done, set aside to cool.
4. Preheat oven to 385F and later we will bake the buns at 375F for 15 to 20 minutes or until the buns get nice golden- brown color
5. After 1 hour proofing, lightly flour the surface and cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Take each piece of dough and roll it into a rope. The middle thicker than the ends. Roll the rope around the hot dogs, tucking in the ends. Place the buns into a baking sheet with a parchment paper on it.

Let the buns rest for 10 minutes.

Brush with egg wash and put sesame seeds on the top of the buns

Bake at 375F for 15 to 20 minutes or until the buns get golden brown color.

\* After 10 minutes of baking, turn the tray around to cook evenly"

Oftentimes when people think of Vietnamese food, they immediately think of pho or banh mi. Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. 

  
Roast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it’s sooo simple: it’s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you’ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!

  
To watch my video on how to make this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  
**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)** 

  
1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably organic and air-chilled, spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs, drumsticks, and wings) 

  
*Marinade ingredients:*

* 4 whole garlic cloves, minced finely 
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1.5 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1.5 Tbsp neutral oil
* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning 

&#x200B;

1. Combine all sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well. 
2. Prepare the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all over the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce between the meat and the skin. 
3. Refrigerate the chicken and allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor penetration. 
4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray. Place chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10 min in to ensure the chicken isn’t browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min. 
5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done. 
6. Once the chicken is done, allow to rest for 15 min to ensure optimal juiciness level. Then, cut and serve with rice and enjoy. "

**For the pork:**


*1 tbsp sunflower oil
*800g piece boneless pork belly, cut into thick slices
*4 tbsp light muscovado sugar
*3 garlic cloves, sliced
*thumb-sized piece ginger sliced
*2 star anise
*100ml Shaosing rice wine
*2 tbsp dark soy sauce
*large pinch of Chinese five-spice powder



**For the buns:**
*250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
*1 tbsp white caster sugar
*1 tsp baking powder
*2 tsp fast-action dried yeast
*50ml milk
*1 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing



**For the crushed chilli peanuts:**
*handful roasted peanuts
*1 tsp chilli powder



**To serve:**
*coriander leaves
*cucumber batons
*shredded spring onion
*Gratted carrot




**Method**

Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish over a medium-high heat. In batches, brown the pork belly well, then transfer to a plate. Tip the sugar into the dish and cook over a medium heat until starting to dissolve and caramelise, then quickly stir in the garlic, ginger and star anise, and cook for 1 min.

Carefully pour in the rice wine and soy sauce – watch out, it will spatter – and simmer to dissolve the sugar. Stir the pork into the caramel to coat, then add 100ml water and the five-spice, and bring to a simmer. Put the lid on and cook in the oven for 1 hr 30 mins. Remove from the oven, uncover, put on a high heat to simmer and reduce the sauce until sticky. Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and chilled. Reheat with a splash of water.

To make the chilli peanuts, mash most of the peanuts using a pestle and mortar, then add the rest of the nuts and roughly crush for a chunky texture. Stir through the chilli powder. Can be made 2 days ahead and stored in an airtight container.

For the buns, tip the dry ingredients and a large pinch of salt into a food mixer fitted with a dough hook. Pour in the milk, oil and 100ml tepid water, and work the mixture for about 10 mins until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to double in size (for about 1 hr)

Tip the dough onto a floured surface and roll into a sausage shape. Cut the sausage into 10 equal portions. Roll each portion into a bun, then use a rolling pin to roll each bun out into an oval. Lightly grease each one, then fold them over a greased chopstick or skewer and place on a lightly oiled baking tray to rest for 1 hr or until doubled in size. Remove the chopstick or skewer before steaming.

Heat a steamer and steam the buns on circles of baking parchment in batches for about 10 mins until puffed up. Split the buns and stuff each one with a slice or two of the pork, drizzled with some of the sauce. Scatter over some coriander, cucumber and spring onions, then sprinkle with the crushed nuts and tuck in.

### Ingredients

#### Crust

* 1 graham cracker pie crust 9"" preferred

#### Glaze

* 2 eggs
* 130 g granulated sugar \~2/3 cup
* 21 g cornstarch \~3 tbsp
* 6 oz whole milk \~3/4 cup
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1-2 drops red gel food coloring
* 25 g freeze-dried strawberries pulsed into a powder, \~3/4 oz

#### Fresh Strawberry Filling

* 1 lb strawberries sliced into quarters, \~3 cups
* 55 g powdered sugar \~1/4 cup

#### Whipped Topping

* 16 oz cold heavy cream \~2 cups
* 55 g powdered sugar \~1/4 cup
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 1 strawberry half for garnish

### Instructions

* Bake crust per package instructions and set aside to cool.
* In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and granulated sugar until incorporated. In a separate bowl, mix 2 tbsp of the milk with cornstarch and stir until smooth. Pour cornstarch mixture into the egg mixture and combine. Warm the remaining milk (1/2 cup + 2 tbsp) and butter over medium heat until steaming, approx 2 minutes (be careful not to bring it to a simmer). Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly, to avoid cooking the eggs.\* Then place the entire mixture into the saucepan on medium heat. Stir constantly until the glaze thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in the red food coloring and powdered freeze-dried strawberries to make that rich, red-pink color!
* Pour the glaze through a fine-mesh strainer into a heat-safe bowl. The strainer ensures a smooth, saucy glaze. Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the glaze to cover and prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the glaze until you're ready to assemble the pie! You'll have enough strawberry glaze for about 2 pies, so you will have plenty.
* With a hand mixer or stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat together the heavy cream, confectioner's, sugar, and vanilla until it forms stiff peaks. Be careful not to overbeat it (it will look curdled if it is). Set aside.
* Spoon about half of the strawberry mixture into the pie crust (you will have extra for second pie if you want!). Spread it all over the bottom and up the edges. Layer on the fresh quartered strawberries on top of the glaze. Sprinkle the 55g or 1/4 cup of powdered sugar on top of the strawberries, then add heaping spoonfuls of the whipped cream over the top. Spread the cream topping in a dome shape over the pie and garnish with a strawberry half."

**Black Trumpet Tagliatelle**

Ingredients

430 g 00 Flour

20 g dehydrated wild mushroom powder

250 g eggs (beaten before mixing)

\*Portioned for 5 - 6 people

Directions

1. Using a spice grinder (or similar) blitz your dried mushrooms into a very fine powder. Here I’m using black trumpets but you could easily substitute with any other edible wild mushroom.

2. Mix together the mushroom powder and flour into a bowl, and dump out onto your clean work surface.

3. Use your hand to form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.

4. Carefully pour your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork. Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.

5. After about 5 - 10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5 minutes until it is no longer shaggy.

6. Use the edges of your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.

7. Cut the dough into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

8. The following steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.

9. Pass the dough through the sheet pasta attachment at it’s widest setting. If it feels sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through until it is light and delicate. For tagliatelle, I normally go to the 6th setting.

10. Allow the sheet of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife, trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds, over and over until you have a nice compact roll.

11. Using your knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. With your fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina. You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.

12. Cook right away of store in the fridge covered with a towel.

**Cacio e pepe**

Ingredients

1 1/2 cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano

1 1/2 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper

3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil

Salt

1.5 cups pasta water

Directions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a dash of salt.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and add in crushed black pepper. Stir until the pepper becomes very fragrant. Turn off the heat.

3. Boil the fresh pasta.

4. Reserve about 1.5 cups of pasta water as the pasta finishes. The starch from the water is why you wouldn’t just use regular water here.

5. Transfer the cooked pasta into the skillet with pepper and oil. Toss until all of the noodles are coated.

6. Add about a cup of pasta water to the noodles and stir. This may feel like a lot but it will all come together when you…

7. Add all of the freshly grated Pecorino to the pasta, and stir very well until the cheese and water form a luxurious creamy coating all over the noodles. Add more pasta water as necessary.

8. Divide the pasta into individual plates and sprinkle on a little more fresh Pecorino. Garnish with basil is optional.

Onion Bhaji is one of my favourite Indian appetisers. I love their crunch and delicious inside. Dip them in a nice sauce and stuff it in your mouth, absolutely fantastic!

Super easy to prepare, served with various dips like mango chutney, mint yoghurt or chilli sauce. On this occasion I prepared simple chilli sauce from my Indian friend's recipe, try it yourself and you will not regret it.

**Ingredients for 15 Bhajis:**

\* 4 medium or 2 large white onions, cut in half and sliced

\* 1 green chilli, seeds removed and finely sliced

\* 1 medium potato, cut into fine matchsticks

\* 1tbsp of garlic and ginger paste

\* a handful of chopped fresh coriander

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 1tsp of mild chilli powder

\* 1tsp of ground coriander

\* 1tsp of turmeric

\* 1tsp of ground cumin

\* 1 large egg (you can skip for the vegan version, reduce the flour by 50g)

\* 150g (5.3oz) of gram flour (made of chickpeas)

\* 1L of vegetable oil for deep-fat frying

**Ingredients for chilli sauce:**

\* 1 red chilli, seeds removed and sliced

\* 1 red bell pepper, diced

\* 1 garlic clove

\* juice of a half lemon

\* 50ml of water

\* 1/4tsp of salt

\* 1/4tsp of sugar

\* 1/4tsp of ground cumin

**Instructions for Bhajis:**

1. Preheat a deep fat fryer or a small pot with oil to 170C (340F) (you can check pot oil temperature with an electric probe)
2. Mix sliced onions with potato matchsticks, green chilli, garlic ginger paste, fresh coriander, salt and spices. Do so until all onions are coated with colours.
3. Mix in one egg to coat the onions then add chickpea flour, combine until no signs of dry flour is left.
4. Use gloves for protection, take a small amount of Bhaji mix and shape in your hands into a ball (do not compress the mix) put it gently into the hot oil. Cook Bhajis until golden-brown then flip upside down for another minute or so to colour the topside. I recommend using a spider strainer or tongs to remove Bhajis from the oil. Place them onto a kitchen paper to drain excess fat.
5. Do it in a few batches until all Bhajis are done, serve straight away or reheat in the oven later before serving.

**Instructions for Chilli sauce:**

1. Place all the ingredients in the bullet like this one and blend into a smooth chilli sauce.
2. Transfer into a bowl to allow air bubbles to escape, then transfer into a serving dish.

## INSTRUCTIONS

&#x200B;

To make the cake layers, prepare two 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper circles in the bottom and grease the sides. Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C). Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium sized bowl and set aside. Add the butter, sugar and vegetable oil to a large mixer bowl and beat together until light in color and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Do not skimp on the creaming time. Add the eggs and mix until completely combined and smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to be sure all ingredients are well incorporated. Add half of the dry ingredients to the batter and mix until mostly combined. Add the vanilla extract and milk and mix until well combined. The batter will look a little curdled, but that’s ok. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix until well combined and smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to be sure all ingredients are well incorporated. Do not over mix the batter.

Divide the batter in half. Put one half into one of the cake pans and spread evenly. Color the color half with the pink and ivory gel color, then spread evenly into the other prepared cake pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few crumbs. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool for about 2-3 minutes, then remove to cooling racks to cool completely. When you’re ready to build the cake, make the filling. Beat the butter until smooth.

Add the animal cookie crumbs and beat until well combined. Add the powdered sugar and 4 tablespoons of water or milk and beat until well combined. Add the vanilla extract, salt and additional water or milk as needed to get the right consistency. Stir in the crumbled animal cookies. To build the cake, torte the two cakes so that you end up with four layers total. Place the first pink layer of cake on a serving plate or cardboard cake circle. Spread about 3/4 cup of the filling into an even layer on top of the cake. Repeat with a layer of white cake and another layer of filling. Add the second layer of pink cake and another layer of filling.

Top the cake with the second white layer of cake. If there’s some frosting sticking out from around the edges, try to smooth it out a bit, then set the cake aside. To make the white chocolate buttercream, add the butter to a large mixer bowl and beat until smooth. Add the melted white chocolate chips in a three batches, mixing until well incorporated and smooth. You want to add it in a few batches to try to ensure that it mixes well, without any lumps forming from the white chocolate.

&#x200B;

Add about half of the powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Add the salt and 3-4 tablespoons of cream, then mix until smooth. Add the remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Add additional cream, as needed, until the buttercream is [the right consistency](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/2017/04/07/get-right-frosting-consistency/). Frost the outside of the cake with the buttercream (use [my tutorial for frosting a smooth cake](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/2015/07/30/how-to-frost-a-smooth-cake-with-buttercream/), if you like), then press sprinkles into the sides of the cake. To make the pink ganache, add the white chocolate chips to a medium sized bowl.

Add the cream to a microwave safe measuring cup and heat just until it begins to boil. Pour the cream over the white chocolate chips and whisk until smooth. If it doesn’t smooth out completely, microwave in 10 second increments, stirring between each, until the white chocolate is melted and smooth. Add the pink icing color until you reach your desired shade. Drizzle the ganache around the edge of the cake, then fill in the center. Pipe some swirls of the remaining buttercream around the top edge of the cake, then finish it off with some additional animal cookies."

INGREDIENTS

- 14 ounces dark chocolate
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 12 Tbsp butter
- 6 large eggs
- ½ cup of light brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 Tbsp Grand Marnier
- 6 Tbsp all purpose flour
- Raw Sugar
- Strawberries
- Blueberries
- Powdered sugar
- Cocoa powder


METHOD

1. We’re going to start by melting chocolate in a double boiler. Boil some water in a pot and place a large glass bowl on top to melt the chocolate in. Place 4 ounces of dark chocolate in the glass bowl and use a rubber spatula to mix. Be sure to keep the water at a simmer, and melt until nice and smooth. Slowly drizzle in ½ cup of heavy cream and stir.

2. Once mixture is fully combined and smooth, place in freezer for 1 hour or until frozen.

3. Using the double boiler again, melt 10 ounces of dark chocolate and 1 ½ sticks of butter (12 Tbsp), mixing until smooth.

4. In a separate bowl combine 6 large eggs and ½ a cup of light brown sugar. Beat the eggs together until they are light and frothy, and then add 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 2 Tbsp of Grand Marnier.

5. Once that’s combined, SLOWLY add the chocolate mixture to egg and brown sugar mixture, and whisk to combine.

6. Now add 6 Tbsp of all purpose flour and stir to combine.

7. Butter some ramekins and coat the inside with raw sugar. This will help get the cakes out of the ramekins.

8. Fill each ramekin a little under halfway with your cake mixture.

9. Remove the chocolate ganache from the freezer and place 1-2 Tbsp into the center of the cake mixture. Fill ramekins the rest of the cake batter.

10. Preheat your oven to 425° F and bake for 11 minutes.

11. While that’s baking quarter some strawberries and set aside.

12. Remove cake ramekins from oven and place on a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge of each cake to help release them from their ramekin.

13. Place a plate on top of the ramekin, flip over so the ramekin is on top, and slowly lift up to make sure the cake is in tact.

14. Plate with some whipped cream, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, strawberries and blueberries.

15. Serve and enjoy!"

**Ingredients:**

* 1 duck breast
* 350 gram sweet potato
* 100 gram spinach
* 100 gram mushrooms (I used Shimei)
* 10 leaves of sage
* 1 shallot
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 100-gram cold butter
* a splash of cream (around 1 tbsp)
* 200 ml port wine (ruby or tawny)
* 200 ml chicken (or poultry) stock
* olive oil for pan-frying

**Directions:**

1. First of all, try to remove your duck breast from the fridge 1 hour before you start cooking to make sure it will be at room temperature when you pan-sear the duck. Then peel your sweet potatoes and cut them into even-sized cubes. Add to a pan, together with 75 ml of water, 50 grams of butter, and a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer and turn low. Let this simmer for about 25 minutes.
2. In the meantime, it is time to prepare the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and saute for 2 minutes on medium heat. Add your stock and port wine and reduce by half or until the reduction thickens. Set this aside, clean your mushrooms and finely chop your garlic. Heat your frying pan and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Fry your sage leaves in the oil for about 20-30 seconds or until crispy and put them on a piece of kitchen paper.
3. Now we are getting there! Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius. Score the fat side of the duck breast (but not too deep) and add it to the already hot pan with the fat side down. Make sure your pan is on medium heat and let the fat render for about 5 minutes or until evenly golden and crispy. Then turn over the duck breast, add a small knob of butter to the pan, and baste your duck for two more minutes. Now add this to an oven dish and continue cooking for about 8 more minutes or until a core temperature of 53 degrees Celsius.
4. In the meantime, we fry our mushrooms with half of the garlic and a bit of olive oil until nicely golden, add them to an ovenproof dish, and put them in the oven next to the duck. Now add some olive oil the rest of the garlic and your spinach to the pan. Saute until it is fragrant and welted down and set aside. Now you mash your sweet potatoes with a tbsp of cream and salt and pepper to taste. Since we used only a little bit of water, we didn't have to drain them before mashing them to create the ultimate texture and flavor. reheat your port reduction and cut off the heat again, add 50 grams of cold butter and combine with a whisk.
5. After your duck hits 53 degrees Celsius you let it rest on your counter for about 10 minutes and then we are ready to plate the dish. Start with a layer of your potato puree and add the spinach and mushrooms on top. Slice your duck into 6 pieces and add 3 pieces to both plates (like in the picture). Finish with the sauce and crispy sage leaves and your dish is finished. Enjoy! 🎄"

I ended up simmering the sauce for too long - it still tasted awesome but it was a little dry. 

Set aside the carved-out insides of the bread to make bread pudding later today.

**Ingredients**

* 16 oz Italian bread loaf
* butter & garlic powder for bread
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 lb ground sausage
* 16 oz tomato sauce
* 6 oz tomato paste
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 7 oz uncooked spaghetti
* 1/2 C Parmesan cheese, divided in half
* 2/3 C Mozzarella cheese, divided in half
* 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning, generous
* 1 tsp salt + a pinch
* 1/2 tsp minced garlic
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 375° Fahrenheit.
2. In a large sauce pan, boil spaghetti until al dente. Remove from heat and drain.
3. While pasta is cooking, brown beef & sausage in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion while browning meat. When brown, drain off any excess fat and return to skillet. Add tomato sauce, paste, Italian seasoning, garlic, salt & pepper. Mix well. Simmer for 5-8 minutes. Add cooked pasta. Mix well again and remove from heat.
4. While meat sauce is simmering, cut the Italian bread loaf in half using a bread knife. Carve out the middle of each half of the loaf. Remove any remaining bread to create a large hollow in each half. Brush insides of the hollows and sides of the halves with butter. Sprinkle with garlic powder. Toast in oven.
5. When bread is toasted, spoon the prepared spaghetti & meat sauce into the hollow of each half, filling the hollows completely. (You will have spaghetti & meat sauce left over). Top with cheeses- 1 of the divided halves of the cheeses for one loaf and one for the other.
6. Bake at 375° for 15-20 or until cheese is melted and golden. Remove from oven and gently cut with a bread knife to serve."

2. **Season and Sear Roast:** Mix chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Rub this seasoning over the chuck roast. Sear in a hot skillet with olive oil on all sides, then transfer to a slow cooker.
3. **Prepare Slow Cooker:** Sprinkle roast with ranch and au jus mixes. Add chopped vegetables, minced garlic, and 2 whole pepperoncini. Dot with butter and pour in beef broth.
4. **Cook:** Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours. When tender, remove and shred the roast. Set aside.
5. **Prepare Sauce:** Remove and discard the 2 cooked pepperoncini from the slow cooker. Skim off excess fat from the liquid. Blend the remaining contents until smooth for a rich sauce. Return the shredded meat to the pot, mixing well.
6. **Roast Corn:** In a skillet over medium-high heat, roast the corn kernels until golden and charred in spots, stirring occasionally. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
7. **Assemble Tacos:** Warm tortillas, then build tacos with purple cabbage, the pot roast mixture, avocado slices, and pickled red onions. Sprinkle over the roasted corn and crumbled queso fresco.
8. **Finish:** Drizzle tacos with Mexican crema, add a garnish of cilantro, and serve each with a lime wedge.

Now that it's summertime, I figured it's the perfect time to try making it since it's a perfect appetizer or light meal for hot weather!

INGREDIENTS

* 1 pound shrimp (about 30 large shrimp; peeled and deveined)
* 1/2 onion
* 1 bell pepper (my personal favorite is orange, but any kind works)
* 1 jalapeno
* 2 tomatoes
* 3 limes
* 2 lemons
* 1/4 cup cilantro (chopped)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 avocado
* Tortilla chips (optional for serving)

**Equipment**

* Pot
* Large bowl

DIRECTIONS

* If using frozen shrimp, defrost by running under cold water in a colander, tossing frequently to allow the shrimp to evenly defrost
* Cut the shrimp into small pieces, about 3 pieces per shrimp
* Bring a pot of water to a boil, then turn off the heat. Add the shrimp and let sit for 30 seconds, then quickly scoop them out using a slotted spoon
* While waiting for the shrimp to cool down, dice the onion, bell pepper, jalapeno, and tomatoes. Make sure to seed the bell pepper, jalapeno, and tomatoes (see my tips for how to do that in the blog post above)
* After the shrimp has cooled down to room temperature, squeeze the lemon and lime juice into the bowl. Add the chopped vegetables, cilantro, and salt and mix well. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for 1-4 hours
* When ready to eat, add sliced avocado, gently mix again, and serve with tortilla chips!

*Serves 2 - 4*

This is one of my favourite ways to eat cabbage. The fried capers are salty, crispy and satisfying, and the savoury black garlic brown butter works wonderfully well with the refreshing tang from the buttermilk dressing, lifted by the lemon.

**INGREDIENTS** 

* 1 head cabbage (savoy, hispi or napa are great)
* 50ml buttermilk
* 2 tbsp. greek yoghurt
* 2 tbsp. mayonnaise
* 1 tsp. honey
* 1 lemon
* 2 tsp. white pepper
* 2 large black garlic cloves
* 1 small shallot
* 30g chopped hazelbuts
* 3 - 4 tbsp. capers
* 90g unsalted butter (approx.)
* fresh chives
* gochugaru

**METHOD**

1. Prepare the dressing by mixing the buttermilk, yoghurt, mayonnaise, honey and  
white pepper together. Finely chop the shallot and add it. Zest all of the lemon and  
set the gratings aside for later, but use ¼ of the juice in the dressing. Mix well until  
pourable.
2. Remove any loose outer leaves from the cabbage and cut straight down the centre  
and then again to make four segments. Heat some oil in a large pan and place them  
face down to caramelise and char a bit. Flip them and do the same on the other face  
side. When both are coloured, turn them onto their backs and add half of the butter  
and begin basting the segments. After a few minutes add the remaining butter along  
with two tbsp. of capers and baste again. Allow the capers to go crispy in the  
browning butter. Move the cabbage around a bit and cook the layers through while  
continuing to baste. A bit of bite is ok, but you can test it by pricking it with a skewer  
or trussing needle. When it is almost ready add the black garlic, chopped into pieces  
and turn the heat off.
3. To serve, place the cabbage segments on a platter or plates and spoon the capers  
and black garlic over the top. Squeeze a little bit more lemon and drizzle the  
dressing. Add some pinches of gochugaru, lemon zest, some chopped hazelnuts,  
some fresh and finely chopped chives. Add one to two more tbsp. of fresh capers if  
desired."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pvwcyy,https://i.redd.it/84v9ekosbvp71.jpg,reddit,"This traditional Polish stew goes back to the times when Poland was ruled by the kings. Bigos Królewski was eaten only by the nobility who could afford exotic spices. A poor men's version of this dish was called Bigos Hultajski and had more cabbage than anything else. Luckily we live in a time when spices and meat are available widely. So let's get cooking!

For Polish Hunter's Stew, I prefer to use a slow-cooker but you can also simmer it in the pot on the stove.

This recipe makes around 6 portions

**Ingredients:**

\-400g (14.1oz) of stewing diced beef (chuck, skirt, leg or flank)

\-250g (8.8oz) of kiełbasa (I used podwawelska but any smoked sausage will do just fine)

\-150g (5.3oz) of lardons ( chopped bacon also can be used)

\-500g (17.6oz) of sauerkraut

\-500g (17.6oz) of white cabbage sliced

\-a handful of dried boletus mushrooms/porcini

\-2 prunes

\-1 large onion, diced

\-1 apple diced

\-2 bay leaf

\-4 allspice berries (1/4tsp if using powder)

\-2tsp of marjoram

\-1tsp of caraway (it helps with the digestion)

\-1tsp of honey

\-2tsp of salt

\-0,5tsp ground black pepper

\-pinch of nutmeg

\-1tbsp of tomato puree

\-1 glass of dry red wine

\-1L (1.05quarts) of water

**Instructions:**

1. Begin by hydrating the mushrooms in 1L of boiling water for around 15 minutes. When ready remove the mushrooms and pour the water into a slow-cooker dish leaving behind the last 50ml of water (usually contains sand).
2. In the frying pan, sear the lardons and sausage, use high heat and do so until browned. Transfer meat to the slow-cooker leaving fat in the pan.
3. In the same pan brown the diced onions then transfer to the slow-cooker.
4. Next, brown the diced beef, do it in two batches then transfer to the crockpot.
5. Add all the remaining ingredients and cover with a lid, set the slow-cooker on high heat for 5 hours. After the first hour give it a good stir, you can repeat string every now and then (I love the aroma so I check every hour :)
6. When the bigos is ready, serve with sourdough bread or boiled potatoes. You can store it in the fridge for up to three days. You can also freeze it if you make a bigger batch. Enjoy!

**Insight:** Bigos tastes better when reheated on the next day, this applies to many meat dishes as with time protein breaks down to tasty amino acids like glutamate bringing more umami flavours.

* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 large shallot, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 4 tablespoons butter
* ¾ cup dry-packed sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped
* Pinch of crushed red pepper
* 1 cup water or vegetable stock

* 12–15 basil leaves, roughly chopped, plus a few leaves for garnish
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ½ cup heavy cream
* ½ cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano

1. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallot and cook for 3–4 minutes until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Sauté the tomatoes:**

1. Melt the butter into the garlic and shallot. Stir often to prevent the garlic from burning. Once the butter is bubbly, add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Cook, stirring regularly, for 2–3 minutes. Season with salt and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Pour in 1 cup water or stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. It should reduce by about half.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and add the pasta. Cook until al dente. Remove 1 cup pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Set aside.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Stir the basil, lemon juice, and cream into the sauce. Turn the heat to medium. It should be bubbling but not boiling. Pour in half the pasta cooking water and whisk in the grated cheese. Continue whisking until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low.

**Sauce the pasta:**

1. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat, adding the remaining ½ cup pasta water as needed to loosen up the sauce. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with fresh basil and more grated Parmigiano Reggiano if you like. Enjoy!"

### Ingredients

* 1 c potatoes, shredded
* 1-1/2 Tbsp butter
* Salt and pepper

### Instructions

* Place shredded potatoes in a bowl and fill with cool water, then immediately drain. Repeat this process about four times, until water runs clear.
* Place potatoes in a mesh sieve, just to drain off excess water, then place potatoes on a clean kitchen towel.
* By twisting and squeezing the towel, squeeze out as much water from the potatoes as possible; repeat several times.
* Heat 1-1/2 Tbsp of butter in a pan over low heat.
* Add 1 c of shredded potatoes to pan and season with salt and pepper to taste.
* Press down lightly on top of potatoes with a spatula, just to flatten it slightly. Then don't touch it.
* After 5 to 6 minutes, when the bottom has firmed up, sticks together, and is lightly browned, flip it over and cook for another 4 minutes.

#### Variation: Loose Shredded Hash Browns

* Follow same steps as above, but instead of pressing the shredded potatoes into a patty, stir them around every minute or so, lightly browning all sides, making sure to keep everything in one thin layer. This technique will take about 6 minutes."

Both can be prepared a couple of days before needed and assembled on the day. Great fun to make with kids!

**Ingredients for Meringue:**

* 4 egg whites (room temperature)
* 160g of icing sugar (to prepare your own superfine sugar use a small electric grinder)
* a handful of blueberries and raspberries

**Instructions for Meringue Nests (makes around 20 small):**

**1.** Preheat the oven to **93C (200F)** and prepare 2 trays with baking paper.

**2.** Put **4 egg whites** into a metal bowl of a stand mixer and beat them on **medium speed** until soft peaks form.

**3.** Continue on **medium speed**, add **icing sugar, a tablespoon at a time** to incorporate. When all sugar dissolves you will have stiff peaks with a nice gloss.

**4.** Transfer mixture to a piping bag, use a nozzle for a different finish.

**5.** Pipe onto the prepared trays by making a flat circle then around the edges to make nests, (if paper moves use a tiny bit of meringue mix as glue).

**6.** Bake meringues for **2-3 hours**, you can leave an oven door slightly open during that time to help the moisture escape.

**7.** Once baked, Meringue Nests should be crispy outside and slightly wet inside. Remove from the oven to cool down, store in an airtight container until needed.

**Ingredients for Lemon Curd:**

* 2 lemons, juice and zest
* 5 egg yolks
* 70g caster sugar
* 50g of cold butter diced into cubes

**Instructions for Lemon Curd:**

**1.** Prepare **Bain-marie**, in a medium pot add a glass of water and bring to boil, place a metal or glass bowl on the top. The steam created under the bowl will be our heat source for gentle cooking.

**2.** In the bowl over Bain-marie add **lemon juice**, **zest**, **egg yolks** and **sugar**. Keep whisking until it thickens then remove from the heat and whisk in the **cold butter**.

**3.** Once incorporated strain the mixture through a sieve and transfer to the fridge to cool down around **1-2 hours**.

**1.** Heat the oven to a 160C fan (320F).

**2.** Place 6, 100ml ramekins into a baking dish, one deep enough that you can cover with tin foil without touching the top of the ramekins.

**3.** Pour double cream and milk into a small pan, and whisk in 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste.

**4.** Put the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk until combined.

**5.** Put the pan with the cream on medium heat and bring it to 80C/176F. As soon as you see bubbles appear, take the pan off the heat (do not boil). Pour the cream mixture into a jug to stop it from heating up more.

**6.** Slowly and in stages pour the hot cream into the beaten egg yolk mixture, stirring with a spoon as you do so. (Do not rush or add too quickly as this will result in scrambled eggs)

**7.** Using a big spoon, scoop off all the foam that is sitting on top of the liquid and discard. Pour the mixture back into a jug.

**8.** Pour enough hot tap water into the baking dish to come about 3/4 up the sides of the ramekins. Pour the hot cream into the ramekins.

**9.** Place tin foil on the top of a baking dish leaving a small gap on both sides of the container. This will allow air to circulate.

**10.** Place the covered dish in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes until the mixture is softly set. To check, gently sway the roasting tin and if the crème brûlées are ready, they will wobble a bit like jelly in the middle. Don’t let them get too firm or too runny.

**11.** Once ready, lift the ramekins out of the baking dish with oven gloves and set them on a wire rack to cool for a couple of minutes, then put them in the fridge to cool completely (1 hour). This can be done overnight as well.

**12.** Before serving, sprinkle 1,5 tsp of caster sugar over each ramekin and spread it out with the back of a spoon to completely cover.

**13.** Use a blow torch to caramelise the sugar. Hold the flame just above the sugar and keep moving it round and round until caramelised.

**Insight:**

\* If no blow torch is available, set your oven on the grill. Place ramekins on a baking tray and caramelise watching carefully not to burn the sugar too much.

\* Egg yolk sets at a temperature between 62-65C (144F-149F)

\* You can keep your Crème Brûlée in the fridge for up to 5 days, and cover it with cling film to avoid smell exchange.

\* For the premium Crème Brûlée, I recommend using organic eggs as their flavour is much better than standard eggs."

# For the Creamy Filling:

* 8 oz (about 1 cup) mascarpone cheese
* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon pure almond extract
* 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

# For Assembling:

* 1 cup brewed espresso, cooled
* 1/4 cup amaretto liqueur (optional, for an extra almond kick)
* 1 package of ladyfingers
* Unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting
* Sliced almonds for garnish

# For the Espresso Soaking Syrup:

**Directions**

# Prepare the Espresso Soaking Syrup

1. In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brewed espresso.

# Whip Up the Creamy Filling

1. In a mixing bowl, combine 8 oz of mascarpone cheese, 3/4 cup of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon of pure almond extract, and 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.
2. Use an electric mixer to whip the mixture until it becomes thick and fluffy.

# Assemble the Layers

1. Start by dipping the ladyfingers one by one into the cooled espresso-soaking syrup. Make sure not to soak them for too long; a quick dip is sufficient.
2. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of your serving dish.
3. Spread half of the creamy filling over the ladyfingers.
4. Repeat the process with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining creamy filling.
5. Finish with a dusting of unsweetened cocoa powder and a garnish of sliced almonds.

# Chill and Serve

1. Cover your almond tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, ideally, overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.

 Author: Kylie Perrotti

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Small skillet

### Ingredients

#### Mushroom Barley Stew

* 2 teaspoons neutral oil for frying
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms sliced, diced, or torn depending on the variety
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery diced
* 6 young carrots diced *(see note)*
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 4 Roma tomatoes diced (or use 1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes)
* 1 cup pearl barley
* 2 tablespoons flour optional
* 6 cups mushroom or vegetable stock plus more, as needed
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon dry chives plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon dry parsley plus more to taste
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more, to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Crispy Mushroom Topping:

* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* 8 ounces mushrooms torn or sliced, depending on variety
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley minced
* Flaky sea salt

### Instructions

#### Cook the Mushrooms:

* Heat oil and butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-12 minutes, stirring often, until well-browned and softened. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl.

#### Cook the Mirepoix:

* If the pot is too dry, add another drizzle of oil. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 5-7 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds.
* Add the diced Roma tomatoes and the barley and cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly. Return the mushrooms to the pot and stir.

#### Add the Stock:

* Sprinkle the flour over the dish and stir to combine. Cook, stirring often, for 2-3 minutes until the flour deepens in color. Be careful not to burn the flour.
* Pour in 1 cup of stock and whisk to combine. Continue adding the stock, one cup at a time, whisking after each addition until all the stock is added. Season with chives, thyme, and parsley. Add the crushed red pepper and season again with salt and pepper to taste.
* Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes until the barley is tender. Stir regularly and add up to 2 cups more stock if necessary. Taste and season again to preference.

#### Fry the Mushrooms:

* Once the stew is ready to serve, crisp up the mushroom topping.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Once very hot, add the mushrooms and cook without moving for 2-3 minutes until very well browned. Flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes until well-browned on the other side. Turn off the heat.
* Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl with freshly minced parsley and sprinkle immediately with flaky sea salt. Toss to coat with parsley.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the mushroom barley stew between bowls and pile the crispy mushrooms on top. Garnish with any remaining parsley. Enjoy!

### Notes

I used young, small carrots which did not need to be peeled. If using larger carrots, you only need 3 carrots. Peel them first.

Pasta:
1 cup flour
1-2 eggs (lightly beaten)
Pinch of salt
Make a well with flour and pour half egg mixture in. Stir with fork until mixed. Add egg as needed. Knead with hands (I try not to over mix as I’ve found that over-mixed dough makes for tougher pasta). Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside while you prepare pesto

We put the dough through to make smooth flat sheets of pasta. Again, we try not to overwork the dough. Once we’re happy with consistency, we put through the final pasta shape we picked.

• 3 pcs medium sized potato (boiled)

•	1 cup flour/maida 

•	1/2 tablespoon salt 

•	1/2 tablespoon black pepper (crushed)

•	1 medium onion (chopped)

•	10-12 cloves of garlic (chopped)

•	1/2 tablespoon red chilli flakes 

•	1/2 cup green peas 

•	1/2 cup mozzarella (shredded)

•	2 tablespoons butter 

•	1 tablespoon olive oil 

Instructions 

1.	Peel the boiled potatoes and put them in a bowl. Mash them with help of a masher. Mash the potatoes for 5-10 min until it's smooth and lump-free.
2.	Add flour, salt and black pepper. Now start kneading the dough. The dough should be soft.
Add more flour if the dough is too sticky.
3.	Rest the dough for 5 min. Now will start making the gnocchis. Sprinkle some flour on the table/working station where you will make the gnocchi.
4.	Take 1/3rd of the dough and roll it into 1 inch logs. Cut into 1 inch pieces. Use flour on the knife as well as otherwise it can stick. You can make design with back of a fork. Just roll the gnocchis on the back of the fork and it will get nice ridges. Or you can keep it as small logs.
5.	Likewise make gnocchis with rest of the dough. Dust flour on the gnocchis to prevent them from sticking.
6.	Boil water and add the gnocchi in batches. Once they start to float, they are cooked. It will take 5-8 mins to cook the gnocchis. Once cooked, strain the excess water and take them out.
7.	In a pan add butter. Add olive oil. Add the gnocchis one by one into the butter.
8.	Fry the gnocchis for 4-5 min each side, medium flame. Flip and fry the other side when its golden on one side.Frying/roasting the gnocchis gives it an extra depth of flavour.
9.	Add onion, garlic, black pepper, red chilli flakes and salt. Saute for 5-6 min on low flame.
10.	Close the lid for 1-2 min, let the onion soften up a bit. Open the lid and add the peas.
11.	Saute the peas with the gnocchi for 1-2 min until it softens.

Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture after they were done cooking (we were hungry!), but they don't look as nice after cooking to be honest. The next time I make it I will keep the following in mind:

&#x200B;

* Cut the apple slices as thin as possible while still showing enough peel to give the red color for the rose. Too thick and the apple slices will break while rolling even with microwaving them to soften them up.
* 45 minutes turned out to be too long in my case as some of the side and bottom were a little blackened. I think 35 minutes may be enough.
* My cinnamon sugar bubbled over a bit and ended up at the bottom of my over, which caused some smoke. I'll be putting a baking sheet under the ramekins next time to prevent this.
* We had with whipped cream, but it really needs vanilla ice cream to make the dish complete."

Adding egg to Silesian dumplings depends on the variety of potatoes used, their dryness and the temperature of the mashed potatoes. Some recipes don't use it at all.

Originally posted [here](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/slow-cooked-beef-stroganoff-with-silesian-dumplings-gherkins)

&#x200B;

Serves 4

**Ingredients for the dumplings:**

* This version of Beef Stroganoff is lighter on the wallet yet full of flavours thanks to slow cooking. Served with Polish potato dumplings and baby gherkins.
* 250g (8.8oz) of potato starch or cornflour
* 13g (0.46oz) of salt
* 1-2 eggs (depending on the moisture of the dough)
* 1tbsp of butter for coating once cooked

&#x200B;

**Ingredients for the Beef stroganoff:**

* 600g (1.3 Pounds) of diced beef (leaner cuts will be ready in 3 hours, ones with more connective tissue may require 6 hours of slow-cooking)
* 2 small onions diced
* 4 garlic cloves slightly crushed
* 800ml (0.84quarts) of beef stock
* 1 large carrot diced (120g (4.2oz))
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 allspice berries
* 300g (10.6oz) of white mushrooms cut in quarters
* 100ml (0.1quarts) of double cream
* 1tbsp of yoghurt/thick sour cream (optional)
* 10g (0.35oz) of dill
* 1tsp sugar
* salt and black pepper to liking
* 10 baby gherkins
* rapeseeds oil
* 1tbsp plain flour
* 1,5tbsp butter

&#x200B;

**1.** Heat the frying pan to moderate heat with a little bit of oil and sear of the diced beef in **2-3 batches** to improve its flavour. When done transfer to the medium-sized pot or slow-cooker.

**2.** Use the same frying pan to sweat the onions and garlic, add **2tbsp of oil** and reduce the heat to medium. After **5 minutes** transfer to the master pot.

**3.** Add **800ml** of beef stock, allspice and bay leaves then bring to a boil and reduce to simmer, when using slow-cooker set it on high (I used a leaner cut that was ready in **3 hours**, others may need up to **6 hours**). In the meantime jump to dumplings.

**4.** When the meat is almost ready, add diced carrots and continue cooking for another **30 minutes**.

**5.** Once the meat is tender, saute diced mushrooms to brown all around and season with salt when almost ready, add to the master pot along with the cream.

**6.** Use the same frying pan to melt **1,5tbsp** of butter then add **1tbsp** of plain flour, once combined, cook on medium heat for around a minute then stir into the master pot to thicken the sauce.

**7.** Finish the sauce by adding fresh chopped dill and **1tbsp** of yoghurt, balance the flavour by adding **1tsp** of sugar and salt and black pepper to your liking.

&#x200B;

**Instructions for the dumplings:**

**1.** Begin by boiling potatoes in salty water until ready for mashing.

**2.** Mash potatoes until smooth, I recommend using a potato ricer as this has a direct impact on the texture of your dumplings.

**3.** Once the dough is combined divide it into two parts and roll each part on the surface with your hands into the size of a rolling pin 

**4.** After **30min - 1hours** potatoes should be ready to work with, place them together in a bowl and add **250g** of potato flour/starch and **2** eggs. Mix together with a spoon and transfer to the worktop to continue kneading by hand.

**5.** Once the dough is combined divide it into two parts and roll each part on the surface with hands into the size of a rolling pin **(5cm diameter (2inch)**.

**6.** Slice the logs to equal rings **1,5cm (0,6inch)** in thickness. Roll each piece in hands to a ball shape then make a dip with your knuckle. Place each dumpling on a cloth ready for boiling.

**7.** To boil dumplings use a pot of slightly salty water, once you add them in, give it a stir and wait until they float to the top, from that moment begin the count to **3-4 minutes** and remove them from the water on to a plate, add butter to coat and serve with the sauce garnished with fresh dill and gherkins.

&#x200B;

**Insight:**

* Adding egg to Silesian dumplings depends on the variety of potatoes used, their dryness and temperature of the mashed potatoes. Some recipes don't use it at all.
* Beef Stroganoff originated in Russia and spread quickly throughout the world, bringing additional ingredients like mushrooms, mustard or tomatoes.
* In Poland, gherkins are served with the dish or added to it in the last stages of cooking."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1fl6zgu,https://i.redd.it/rp3rwc6naxpd1.png,reddit,"Full recipe with pictures HERE: [https://www.dinnerwithevie.com/recipes/ragu-stuffed-aubergines](https://www.dinnerwithevie.com/recipes/ragu-stuffed-aubergines)

Ingredients

* 1 large aubergine
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Sea salt and black pepper
* approx. 180g leftover ragù
* 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of garlic granules
* 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
* 1 ball of fresh mozzarella (approx. 240g)
* 6 tablespoons of passata

NOTE: This is a recipe for leftover ragù. Whatever you have will do, but I'd recommend one that's heavy on the meat and light on the tomatoes. **Ragu alla Ferrarese** is my personal favourite.

# Step 1

Start heating your oven to 200°C. While it's warming up, cut your aubergines in half. **You can leave the stems on, or cut them off, at your discretion.**

# Step 2

Using **a small, sharp knife,** roughly trace a border around the edges of the aubergines (just under half an inch thick). **Score the flesh within that border to make it easier to scoop out and speed up the dicing process.** Then scoop out the scored flesh with a metal spoon.

# Step 3

At this point, you have two options depending on how much time you have and how soft you like your aubergine:

1. Sprinkle salt on your aubergine shells and put them to the side.
2. Garnish your aubergine shells with olive oil, salt and pepper, and put them in the oven for 10 minutes while you prepare the filling.

# Step 4

With your aubergine shells either cooking or resting, dice up the aubergine flesh, and cook in a small pan for 4-5 minutes with some oil, salt, pepper, garlic granules, and a little oregano.

**Soon enough, your aubergines (if you put them in the oven) will be ready to come out.** Don't forget about them!

# Step 5

Once the diced aubergine has softened, add your ragù to the pan and keep the heat on low for 2 minutes while you stir it through and combine it with the aubergine.

# Step 6

Now for the fun part. Scoop the aubergine and ragù mixture into your aubergine shells. Then pour on enough passata (around 3 tablespoons per aubergine half) to cover the filling.

**Slice your ball of mozzarella into fairly thick rounds** and layer it on top of the passata.

# Step 7

Drizzle with olive oil - paying extra attention to any exposed aubergine if your aubergine halves were not pre-cooked - and crack on some black pepper.

# Step 8

Pop your aubergine halves into **a small lasagna dish or baking dish with high sides**, and cook uncovered for approximately 25 minutes.

# Step 9

Carefully move your stuffed aubergine to a plate to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. And you're done! Enjoy your ragù stuffed aubergine on its own or with a simple salad."

**Ingredients:**

* 250 gram butter
* 200 gram dark chocolate, roughly chopped
* 100 gram cocoa powder
* 200 gram white sugar
* 200 gram dark brown sugar
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp salt
* 6 large eggs
* 130 gram all-purpose flour
* 1 bag mixed nuts (optional)
* 200 gram white chocolate in rough chunks (optional)

**Directions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Then grease your oven pan with a small piece of butter and line with the parchment paper. On low heat melt your butter in a small saucepan and add half of the cocoa powder and the chopped dark chocolate to a heat-proof bowl. When the butter is completely melted, pour over the chocolate mixture and set aside. After a few minutes stir this mixture to make sure all the chocolate is melted.
2. Now we add the two types of sugar, the vanilla extract, salt, and eggs to a large mixing bowl or your kitchen aid. Mix this on high speed for 10 minutes until nice and fluffy. Adjust your mixer to the low setting and slowly pour in your chocolate/butter mixture until combined.
3. Now add the flower and the cocoa powder to the mixture (preferably using a sieve) and gently mix this with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula make sure to stop stirring when everything is combined (don’t over-mix). This is also the moment when I add my optional chocolate and nuts.
4. Add the mixture to your pan and bake your brownies in the oven for around 40 minutes, if you want them to be fudgy. Otherwise, you can bake them for about 60 minutes for a more firm/baked texture. Let the brownies cool down completely before removing them from the pan; this is probably the hardest part. Enjoy!"

I can honestly say this is one of the chocolatiest, smooth and melt-in-your-mouth cake I've ever made. The almond taste comes through at the very end and the chocolate is just oh so good. 
  
  
  
Full credit goes to America's test Kitchen for this recipe, I saw their video, made it once, then I decided to make it for a video because I couldn't believe how good it was.  
  
  
Ingredients:  
\- Bittersweet Couverture Chocolate 60%-70% 130g  
\- Butter 130g  
\- Vanilla Extract 3/4 tsp  
\- 3 Egg Whites  
\- 3 Egg Yolks  
\- Sugar 150g (Split into 75g each)  
\- Almond Meal 150g  
\- 1.5 tbsp Cocoa Powder  
\- 1/2 tsp Salt  
\- Icing Sugar  

Recipe:  
\- Melt Chocolate and Butter over a double boiler or the microwave, add Vanilla Essence, set aside  
\- Beat the Egg Whites into stiff peaks, adding 75g sugar in stages while beating, set aside  
\- Beat the Egg Yolks and 75g Sugar until creamy and airy  
\- Add the Almond Meal, Salt & Cocoa Powder and mix until combined  
\- Add 1/3 of Egg White and incorporate into the mix  
\- Fold in the remaining 2/3 Egg Whites slowly  
\- Grease a springform pan and line it with parchment

\- Let it rest for 20 min, remove the springform lock  
\- Let it cool down for 2 hours, and decorate with Icing Sugar  
I know people are going to ask about the flourless, ""Gluten Free"" cake. I just saw the recipe and though it looked good, and honestly I like experimenting with other methods of cooking. The gluten free cakes that I've had before are usually not that good, but this looked good, I made it, and it was good!  
  
  
  
Notes:  
  
\- Spread the icing sugar further away from the cake to make it look better, I did it to close to the cake and it looked like a blizzard instead of a gentle snowfall  
  
\- Grease your pan with parchment. the first time I did it, I did it without the parchment and it was quite difficult to take it out.  
  
\- Eat it with Vanilla ice cream, please.

Making the Cake:

Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour (125 g)

- 1/2 tsp baking soda

- 1/2 tsp cinnamon

- 1/4 tsp nutmeg

- 1/4 tsp salt

- 4 tbsp butter (56 g)

- 1/4 cup brown sugar (50 g)

- 2 tbsp granulated white sugar (25 g)

- 1 large egg

- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

- 2 tbsp buttermilk (30 ml)

- 1 ripe large banana (mashed)

Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Butter and flour a 6-inch (15 cm) bundt pan.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.

3. In a medium saucepan, cook butter over medium heat until melted and browned, stirring constantly. It should take about 3 minutes. You will see it change color and aroma with brown bits forming at the bottom. Immediately take it off the heat and pour into a medium bowl.

4. Whisk together the browned butter and both sugars. Whisk in egg, vanilla and buttermilk. Then mix in the mashed banana. Pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Fold together until just combined, do not over-mix. Pour batter into prepared bundt pan.

5. Bake for 24-26 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted the cake comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. You may need to run a knife or offset spatula around the cake to loosen it from the sides of the pan.

Making the Glaze: 

Ingredients

- 1 cup powdered sugar (130 g)

- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

- 1/2 tsp espresso powder

- 1 tbsp melted butter

- 1 tbsp corn syrup or honey

- 1/4 tsp salt

- 1 to 2 tbsp milk (15 to 30 ml) [or as needed]

Directions

1. Whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla, espresso, melted butter, corn syrup or honey, salt, and a tablespoon of milk. If glaze is still powdery or clumpy, whisk in more milk a little at a time. The idea is to get as thick of a glaze as possible without it being powdery or clumping up. Hence, add the milk sparingly.

Making the Crumble:

Ingredients

- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour (31 g)

- 2 tbsp brown sugar (25 g)

- 1 tbsp white granulated sugar (13 g)

- 1/4 tsp cinnamon

- pinch of salt

- 1 tbsp melted butter

Directions

1. Heat flour in the microwave in 20-30 second intervals, stirring in between, until it reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) on a food thermometer. This took me about 2 intervals. This purpose is to heat the flour to make it edible without baking it.

2. Add in both sugars, cinnamon, salt, and melted butter.

3. Stir with a fork until mixture forms a coarse crumble. If mixture looks too dry, add in a little bit more melted butter.

Assembly:

1. Using a spoon or piping bag, glaze the top of your cooled cake with the coffee glaze you made earlier and let the glaze drip down the sides.

2. Sprinkle the top of your cake with the cinnamon crumble.

3. Slice and enjoy!"

PREP TIME: 15 minutes

COOK TIME: 40 minutes

TOTAL TIME: 55 minutes 

SERVINGS: 5 

CALORIES: 290kcal

### Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot

### Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 1/4 cup avocado oil
* 2 Yukon gold potatoes, about 3/4 pound total, peeled and diced
* 1 head of garlic, divided
* 1 big turnip, divided
* 2 15- ounce can white beans, like butter or great northern, drained and rinsed
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* Fresh herbs for garnish, like celery leaves or parsley
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Prepare the ingredients:

* Peel the garlic cloves. Thinly slice three of the bigger cloves and then mince the remaining. Peel the turnip and cut off about 1/4 of the turnip. Dice the larger half of the turnip. Very thinly slice the smaller half of the turnip into paper-thin half-moons.

#### Boil the potatoes:

* Cover the Yukon gold potatoes with water in a medium pot and season with salt. Bring to a boil and then cook until fork tender. Scoop out 3 cups of the potato cooking water and set aside. Drain the potatoes and transfer them to a second bowl and then mash until completely smooth. Set aside. Wash out the pot used to cook the potatoes and return it to the stovetop as you will use it to fry the turnips.

#### Cook the beans:

* Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a wide pot. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 45 seconds being careful not to burn it. Add the white beans and Dijon mustard and stir to coat. Add the 3 cups of potato cooking water along with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil.

#### Whisk in the mashed potatoes:

* Spoon the mashed potatoes into the broth and whisk until completely smooth. Continue whisking until the potatoes are fully incorporated into the broth. It will take a few minutes for it to completely combine into a smooth broth. Just keep whisking! Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add more water, as necessary, to thin the broth out to your desired consistency.

#### Simmer the broth:

* Add the diced turnips to the broth and reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until the turnips are fork-tender.

#### Fry the turnips:

* Add the avocado oil to the pot used to cook the potatoes and turn the heat to medium or medium-high depending on your stove. Once hot and shimmering, add the very thinly sliced turnips in an even layer and cook, turning occasionally, for 1–2 minutes per side until golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.
* Add the thinly sliced garlic to the hot oil and stir constantly for 1 minute until golden brown. Spoon onto the paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.

#### To serve:

* Taste the broth once more and season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat. Ladle the broth into bowls and garnish with the crispy turnips and garlic. Add your favorite herbs on top. Enjoy!

Ingredients 

•	2 cups maida/flour 

•	1/4 cup milk powder 

•	2 teaspoons yeast 

•	3 teaspoons sugar 

•	1 tablespoon vegetable oil 

•	2 cups warm water 

•	1/2 tablespoon salt 

•	4 tablespoons butter 

•	1 tablespoon garlic (finely chopped)

•	1 tablespoon coriander leaves (finely chopped)

Instructions 

1.	In half cup of hot water, add the sugar and the yeast. Stir in well and let it sit for 10-15 min.
2.	Take a large bowl, add the flour, salt and milk powder. Mix evenly and add the bloomed yeast.
3.	Mix evenly (if needed add water, depends on the flour). Start kneading with clean hands. The dough should be soft, so you can either add
water if its too hard or use flour if too soft.
4.	It will take 10-15 mins to form a smooth dough.Once the dough is ready, rub some oil on top. Cover with a damp towel and let it proof for 4 hrs+, keep in warm and dry place.
5.	After proofing it will double up in size. Knead again for 2 min.
6.	For making naan, take golf ball sized dough and form a smooth ball. Roll it with rolling pin in whatever shape you want.
7.	Naans are basically pulled with hands so they need not to be any specific shape. You can do as you like. But I like mine oval. So I did oval ones.
8.	Once the naan is rolled, sprinkle garlic and coriander on top (you can add sesame seeds as well) and roll once to make them stick.
9.	You can pull and stretch the naan dough with hands as well to make the bread if you don't have rolling pin or want that rustic feel.
10.	On a hot tawa/fry pan place the naan. Keep the flame medium, close the lid. After 5 min, open the lid. Brush some butter on top. Flip the naan and fry it for another 5-10 min, medium flame.
11.	Brush butter on the other side as well. Don't over fry it will turn rubbery, let it get slightly charred.
12.	Brush some butter again and take out.Take out and serve immediately."

While you may not see scallops in curry sauce all that often, believe me, these spicy coconut curry scallops are delicious!

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 25 minutes

Total Time: 35 minutes

Servings: 4 as an appetizer

## Equipment

* Wide pot

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 4 Roma tomatoes quartered
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon coconut curry paste (your favorite brand, Thai or Indian style... I used a Thiyal tamarind-coconut curry paste!)
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper optional
* 1 teaspoon chili powder optional
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 1 pound scallops side muscle removed
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cilantro or parsley leaves optional, for garnish
* Red pepper flakes optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Char the Tomatoes:

* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high. Once very hot and shimmering, add the tomatoes, cut-side down, and cook without moving for 3-5 minutes. Once charred, flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

## Brown the Curry Paste:

* Melt the butter into the pot and add the coconut paste. Lightly mash it with the back of your spoon and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the crushed red pepper and chili powder, if using, and lightly sauté until fragrant, about 45 seconds.

## Simmer the Sauce:

* Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Taste and season to your preferences. Reduce heat to medium and add the coconut milk. Allow to bubble on medium heat for 10 minutes. Do not allow the sauce to reduce too much or to boil too hard.

## Cook the Scallops:

* While the sauce simmers, pat the scallops dry and remove the side muscle. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
* Gently place the scallops in the broth in an even layer and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the scallops to rest for 1 minute. Remove the lid. If the scallops are opaque, serve immediately. If they need to cook a little longer, cover again and allow the residual heat from the broth to cook them. Do not overcook them!

## To Serve:

* Ladle the coconut curry broth and charred tomatoes into a shallow bowl and arrange the scallops in the broth. Garnish with fresh cracked pepper, red pepper flakes, and herbs like cilantro or parsley leaves, if desired. Serve with cooked basmati rice or naan bread, if desired. Enjoy!

Just as a note - if you’re on an electric stove, bring your heat down a few minutes before you add the scallops!!"

**Cooking Time: 15 minutes**

**Ingredients (serves 2-3):**

* 400g gnocchi
* 2 raw chicken breast fillets
* 100ml single cream
* Milk
* 2 handfuls baby spinach
* 1 chicken stock cube
* 1 tbsp dried sage
* 1 tbsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
* White pepper
* Garlic paste
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp grated Parmesan
* Hot water to hand

**Directions**

1. Cut the chicken breast fillets into strips and then \~2cm cubes
2. Season the chicken generously with white pepper and plenty of garlic paste (15-20cm if squeezed from a tube)
3. Thoroughly mix the chicken and garlic paste and ideally set aside for 10-20 minutes to let it penetrate.
4. Add the oil to a wok or large non-stick pan and heat very strongly.
5. When the oil is almost smoking, make sure the whole pan is coated and add the chicken. **Do not stir or toss.** Instead, use tongs to reposition the pieces of chicken so that each is in contact with the pan.
6. Cook without stirring, checking the bottom of the chicken pieces until they are golden-brown.
7. Quickly toss the chicken to seal it on all sides (don't cook it through yet) and then remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving any oil and juices behind. Put the chicken in a pan or bowl and cover.
8. Add a little more oil if the pan is dry, and reduce the heat to moderate (it's a good idea to lift the pan off for thirty seconds or so to let it cool to avoid scorching the spices)
9. Add the chilli flakes, oregano, and sage to the pan and heat for a few seconds until fragrant.
10. Crumble over the stock cube and add a splash of hot water.
11. Add the gnocchi, tossing and stirring thoroughly untill all the pieces are glazed.
12. Add the single cream and stir gently until the gnocchi starts to absorb the liquid and the mixture thickens.
13. Gradually add milk, continuing to stir, until the sauce resembles a creamy soup and is bubbling, and the gnocchi has almost fully cooked.
14. Add the chicken and spinach to the pan, stir thoroughly to coat all the spinach, and continue to cook. **Loosen the sauce with a little hot water as needed to keep it at a creamy soup consistency.**
15. Once the spinach has wilted and the chicken just cooked through, quickly add the grated parmesan, stir, and add a final splash of hot water if needed. The sauce will continue to thicken after serving, so err on the side of keeping it loose.
16. Serve immediately.

**Notes:**

The chicken is ready to serve when the chunks peel easily in two with a fork and the meat within is white, glossy, and steaming. It will quickly become chewy if left on the heat much beyond that point, so be ready to plate up!

If preparing a larger quantity, do the browning of the chicken in batches, and empty any liquid out of the pan into the bowl with the chicken between batches. If you try to cook too much at once, you'll get a lot of moisture buildup in the pan and the chicken will poach rather than browning. Once all the chicken is browned, tip the juices back into the pan with the spices and continue with the recipe.

You can prep and refrigerate the marinated raw chicken in advance for even more flavour."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nan8ux,https://i.redd.it/dsewyouqloy61.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients:

2 large Chicken Breasts

2 Yellow Onions

2 Portobello Mushroom Cups or 6oz of any Mushroom

5 Cloves of Garlic

9oz of Fresh Mozzarella cheese

4 slices of Prosciutto ham

1 cup of Heavy Cream

1/2 cup of White Wine (optional)

Fresh Thyme

[full recipe with pictures here](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/chicken-roulade-with-mushrooms-in-creamy-sauce/)

1. Prepare chicken breast

Paper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1/2 inches to it. This way you will ""butterfly"" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. 

Cover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.

2.  Make mushroom stuffing 

Mince 5 cloves of garlic and sauté it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep sautéing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. 

Add a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. 

At that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.

3. Roll!

Place your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. 
Divide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. 

Using a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. 

Next, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.

Gently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.

Now it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!

Twine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. 

4. Sear roulade 

Preheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. 

Add your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.

5. Sauce and bake

Gently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.

Finally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). 

Place pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes. 
To add some amazing color broil on High for just a minute before taking it out of the oven."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**This recipe makes: 6 portions**

**Ingredients for Polish Apple Pancakes:**

\* 2 medium-sized apples, peeled and diced into small pieces

\* 1egg

\* 3tbsp of sugar

\* 1tsp of baking powder

\* 1.5 cups of plain flour (185g)

\* 0.5 cup of milk (125ml)

\* 1/2 lemon juice (skip if your apples are already very sour)

\* 1tsp of vanilla extract

\* oil for frying

\* icing sugar for dusting

&#x200B;

**How to prepare Polish Apple Pancakes:**

**1.** In a bowl, mix the diced apples with the juice of half a lemon. Set aside until later. Skip the lemon juice if the apples are already sour enough.

**2.** In a separate mixing bowl, whisk 1 egg and 3 tbsp of sugar until pale yellow, which should take around 2 minutes.

**3.** Add 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk. Whisk the mixture until it's smooth and free of lumps. If the batter seems too thick, add 20ml more milk. Keep in mind that higher protein flour absorbs more liquid.

**4.** Fold in the diced apples and mix them into the batter. (Alternatively you can grate them instead for different texture)

**5.** Heat a frying pan over medium heat with 1 tbsp of oil. Add 2 tbsp of pancake mix to the pan, and spread it slightly into the desired shape. Fry the pancake on each side for around 2 minutes. If the pancake browns too quickly, turn down the heat.

**6.** Once the pancake is cooked, dust it with icing sugar, and enjoy your delicious Polish apple pancake (Racuchy z Jabłkami)!

## Equipment

* Skillet
* 9×13 Baking Dish
* Baking sheet

## Ingredients

* 1 pound challah or brioche bread cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 sweet onions peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons butter divided
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and small-diced
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh sage leaves minced
* 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary minced
* 3 cups vegetable stock
* 2 eggs
* 4 tablespoons butter melted
* 2 teaspoons fig miso or white miso
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooking spray or butter for greasing the baking dish

## Instructions

## Dry out the bread:

* Preheat oven to 200ºF. Arrange the diced bread on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a 9×13 baking dish.
* Remove the bread from the oven and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Turn the heat on the oven to 350ºF.

## Caramelize the onions:

* Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until they just begin to deepen in color. Sprinkle with salt and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue cooking for 30 minutes or until the onions begin to caramelize. Stir them occasionally, but don’t disturb them too often or else they won’t caramelize.
* Melt 1 tablespoon butter into the onions and sprinkle the sugar on top. Continue cooking for 10–15 minutes until they are fully caramelized.
* Spoon half of the onions into a bowl and pour the remaining half over the diced bread and toss gently to distribute them evenly.

## Cook the celery:

* Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium heat. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into the celery and cook for 7–8 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the minced herbs and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the celery mixture over the bread and toss gently to distribute the celery evenly.

## Prepare the liquid:

* Combine the vegetable stock and eggs in a bowl and whisk until completely combined. Pour over the bread.

## Bake the stuffing:

* Scatter the remaining caramelized onions on top of the stuffing. Cover with foil and transfer to the oven for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking an additional 10 minutes until the middle has set and the top is golden brown. Remove the stuffing from the oven and turn on the broiler.

## Prepare the miso butter:

* Combine the melted butter and miso in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour the mixture over the stuffing.

## Broil the stuffing:

* Transfer the stuffing to the oven under the broiler for 2–3 minutes. Keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t burn, but the butter should cause the bread to crisp up and turn deep golden brown. Remove from the oven.

## To serve:

* Serve the stuffing warm. Keep leftovers in an airtight container for 3–4 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for up to a month. Enjoy!

4. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to evenly distribute the heat.
5. Add the tomato wedges and nestle the king prawns into the rice. Continue to cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through, and the rice is tender. You can cover the pan at this stage with a lid and do not stir it to develop delicious soccarat.
6. Remove the pan from the heat. Squeeze in the juice of one lime and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan back with a lid and let it rest for 5 minutes.
7. Sprinkle the paella with chopped parsley for a fresh finish. Serve directly from the pan, ensuring each portion includes some of the delicious socarrat (caramelized and slightly crispy layer of rice that forms at the bottom of the pan)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 9x13 inch glass baking dish with non-stick baking spray.
2. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and mix well.  
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat eggs and sugar until very light and fluffy. This make take several minutes depending on the speed of your mixer. The mixture is done when it leaves a ribbon behind when stirred.
3. For the remainder of the recipe I prefer to mix by hand. Add half of the flour mixture and fold together gently. Mix in milk and then remaining flour mixture. Take care to fold gently and only until the flour and milk are just combined. Over mixing will create a tough cake crumb.
4. Pour batter into prepared baking dish and bake 15-20 minutes, until toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out mostly clean.  
Allow cake to cool on wire rack while you make the milk mixture.
5. In a small pot combine cream, evaporated milk and cinnamon stick and warm over medium heat for 10-15 minutes. This allows the cinnamon stick to infuse the milk.  
Remove from the heat and add sweetened condensed milk, ground cinnamon and vanilla. Whisk well to combine.
6. Poke holes all over cooled cake, I use a fork for this. Slowly pour milk mixture over cake. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to refrigerate for several hours, up to overnight.
7. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment combine heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla and cinnamon.
8. Whisk on medium speed until beginning to thicken. Turn mixer to medium-high speed until thickened and holds soft peaks.

Sweet and spicy venison + pork sausage patty, melted cheddar cheese, and a fried egg on top of a homemade sourdough English muffin. This is my version of Thomas’ English Muffin where I tried to replicate the textural experience with a naturally leavened dough. They’re super easy to make once you have an active starter and dare I say better than the original.  [Recipe as follows below, and I made a very short video detailing the process here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ClyBx6wP0) 

**The Sourdough English Muffins**

Day 1 Evening

Make your sponge with 110 g active starter, 260 g bread flour, 276 g whole milk and set out to rest overnight at room temperature for approximately 8 hours.

Day 2 Morning

Add another 75 g bread flour, 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of baking soda, 1.5 tsp of honey, and 1.5 tsp of melted butter. Knead for about ten minutes until all the ingredients are well incorporated. Flour your working surface and roll the dough out to about half an inch thick. Using a circular form, punch out circles of the dough and dust them with a light coat of semolina. Set aside and let proof for about 45 to 60 minutes. 

Lightly oil a cast iron skillet and set to medium/low heat. Cook muffins directly in the pan for about 7 minutes on each side until golden/toasted brown. Cool on a wire rack and split open with a fork. 

**The Sausage Patties**

  1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage

   1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme

   2 teaspoons light brown sugar

   1½ teaspoons kosher salt

   1 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds

   ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

   ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

   ¼ teaspoon garlic powder

   ¼ teaspoon sweet paprika

   .5 pound ground pork 

   .5 pound ground venison

Mix sage, thyme, brown sugar, salt, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika in a medium bowl. Add pork and venison and work spice mixture into meat with your hands until it's very well blended.

Using your hands, form approximately 3 - 4 inch patties about ¼ inch thick.

Griddle sausage over medium-high heat until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook 2 minutes more. Use a grill press to ensure a thin and crispy patty. 

**The Sandwich**

Lay your split English muffin open on a cast iron skillet and top with good quality cheddar cheese. Set into a broiler until the cheese melts. Meanwhile fry your egg in another pan with a generous amount of butter. Set the sausage patty on top of the melted cheese followed by the fried egg gently placed on top so it doesn’t break. Season with salt and pepper and the top half of the muffin. The sausage is already a little spicy but add hot sauce to your liking."

## Preparing Traditional Bibimbap:

1. First, cook 1 cup of short-grain white rice with 1 cup of water in a rice cooker or on a stove top. Add 1 square of dashima and a pinch of salt on top of the rice before cooking.
2. Julienne 1/2 a zucchini and 1 carrot.
3. Cut the ends off of 300g of spinach.
4. Tear 200g of baby oyster mushrooms apart.
5. Heat up oil on medium high heat, and add the julienned zucchini. Sprinkle with salt and sautee until fragrant, then place on a plate.
6. Using either a new pan or the same pan cleaned and with new oil, prepare the carrots the same way as the zucchini, but sprinkle with less salt to maintain the carrot’s sweetness.
7. Fill up a small pot with water and bring to a boil. Boil the spinach for only 30 seconds, then wash in ice water immediately. Squeeze it lightly to dry, then mix with 1 Tbs sesame oil and a pinch of salt.
8. Using either a new pot or the same pot with new water, bring the water to a boil and add the mushrooms. Cook the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes, wash in ice water immediately, squeeze, and add 1 Tbs of sesame oil and a pinch of salt, just like the spinach.
9. 1 more pot of fresh water, but this time add the bean sprouts while the water is cold. Bring the water to a boil, wait 1-3 more minutes, then prepare the same as the mushrooms and spinach.
10. Heat up fresh oil in a clean pan on medium high heat, add 2 cloves of minced garlic, and 200g ground beef. Loosen up the beef with your spatula or spoon. Add 1 Tbs of soy sauce, 1 Tbs of sesame oil, 1 Tbs of water, 1 Tbs of sugar. Stir continuously until the sauce has completely absorbed into the meat.

## Plating Traditional Bibimbap:

1. Pack the white rice into a small bowl, and flip into a large bowl.
2. Arrange all of your vegetables and meat around your bowl in beautiful clusters.
3. Create a divet in the middle of your rice, then add either a single raw egg yolk, or an egg sunny-side-up in the middle of your rice. Sprinkle the bibimbap with sesame seeds. 

## Preparing the sauce:

Mix 1 Tbs of red pepper paste (gochujang) and 3/4 Tbs sesame oil."

**Ingredients**

* 3 pound skin-on, boneless pork belly
* 1 tablespoon Chinese five spice powder
* ½ tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* ½ tablespoon vegetable or canola oil
* 2 ½ teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon light brown sugar

**Instructions**

1. Mix together five spice, 1 teaspoon salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and brown sugar.
2. Place pork belly, meat-side up, on a working surface. Rub this spice blend evenly on the meat-side only, plus the sides of the pork belly.
3. Flip the pork belly over to the skin-side. Try to not get spices on the skin! Use paper towels to pat dry the skin as best as possible.
4. With a sharp knife, score (poke) the skin. Do NOT go too deep, into the meat. These poke marks should be about ½-inch apart.
5. Rub ½ tablespoon salt evenly on the skin.
6. Place a large piece of foil underneath the pork belly, meat-side down touching the foil. Wrap the foil up the sides of the pork belly, tightly wrapping around it like a foil boat. Foil should come up the sides without touching the top of the pork belly (the skin).
7. Place pork belly in the foil boat, on a baking sheet. Let chill in the fridge, uncovered, for 2 hours.
8. Preheat the oven to 375℉. Mix together oil and vinegar. Use a basting brush to brush the skin with this mixture. It will look like too much, but use it all!
9. Roast pork in the foil boat on a baking sheet for 55-70 minutes. Foil boat will peel away from the pork belly as it roasts. The center of a meat layer (not fat layer) should register at least 165 degrees. It’s okay if the temperature is a bit over.
10. Remove pork belly from the oven, turn oven off, and leave oven door open for 5 minutes to let oven cool. This ensures oven broiler will work correctly.
11. Turn broiler on (I use low setting if you have one). Place pork belly back in the oven and let broil for 5-15 minutes until skin is crispy. Watch carefully! Pork belly skin will pop and crackle, crisping up. Rotate pork belly if needed, to ensure even crackling. If there’s a spot that’s burning, cover with a little piece of foil.
12. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving with hoisin or your favorite dipping sauce."

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/](https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 10 lb pre-cooked ham (approximate weight)
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 c brown sugar, packed
* ¼ c honey
* 1 tablespoon brown mustard
* ½ c pineapple juice
* ¼ c apple juice
* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground cloves  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish, to help keep it juicy.
3. If you have a spiral-cut ham, there’s nothing else to do. Otherwise, make ¼″ deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later).
4. Place in the oven and bake.
5. A ham will take about 1 to 1-½ hours to cook through. After 1 hour, check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F.
6. At about the 1-hour mark, start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
7. Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. 
8. Once the butter has melted, add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
9. Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes. 
10. Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
11. Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F).
12. When it’s getting close to that point, but has about a half hour left, baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham. 
13. Fifteen minutes later, brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F.
14. Serve and enjoy!"

### Ingredients

#### For the Cake

* 3 ripe bananas mashed
* 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt 
* 1/3 cup applesauce 
* 1/4 cup butter unsalted, softened 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup sugar granulated
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1/3 cup cocoa powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cup chocolate chunks

#### For the Ganache

* 2 cups chocolate chunks
* 1 cup half and half (10% cream)

### Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. Add the rest of the cake ingredients and mix well.
* Pour the batter into a very well greased bundt pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until you can insert a toothpick and it comes out clean. Cool the cake for 10-15 minutes in the pan, and then transfer to a plate or cooling rack.
* While the cake it cooling, microwave the half and half cream for 1-2 minutes, or until it's very hot. Pour it over the chocolate chunks and wait 5 minutes. Stir the mixture well until the chocolate is fully incorporated. Wait until the cake is cool enough to touch, and then drizzle the ganache over the entire cake. Wait 15 minutes until the ganache sets, and enjoy!

### Notes

I used chocolate chunks to get bigger areas of chocolate in the cake. You can use chocolate chips, or any type of chocolate that is most convenient for you. Applesauce is a great replacement for oils or fats in a recipe. To cut down on some calories, you can use extra applesauce and eliminate the butter. The ganache recipe I have here is much more thick than you’d usually make. This is because I wanted a nice thick frosting-like layer on the cake."

This dish is commonly served during birthdays and family gatherings. You can customize this recipe to include meat or seafood of your choice!

Everything you need to know is below with a [quick tutorial here](https://youtu.be/1H_VynwAT14) :D

* shiitake mushrooms
* oyster mushrooms
* 2 scallions
* 1/2 bunch spinach

RECIPE 

1. Let the glass noodles soak while cooking the vegetables. Soak for \~20 minutes.
2. Slice all of the ingredients.
3. Flip over the noodles to soak them evenly.
4. Blanch the spinach. Squeeze out the excess water afterwards. Add 1/2 tsp of soy sauce and sesame oil each to the spinach and mix evenly.
5. Separate the yolk and egg white. Add a pinch of salt to each and mix.
6. On Medium heat, cook the eggs separately.
7. Set the heat to Medium High and add sesame oil. Cook all of the sliced ingredients separately (except for the chopped white part of the scallion and garlic). Add a pinch of salt while cooking.
8. Boil 3-4 quarts of water. Add in 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and the chopped scallion and garlic. Then add the glass noodles and let it boil for \~8 minutes. Before you drain the noodles, try it first to see if it’s cooked as desired.

Makes: 10 spring rolls

Time: \~45 mins

Nutrition: \~100 Cal for 1 roll + 1/10 of sauce

Original recipe:  [https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-veggie-spring-rolls-with-peanut-sauce/](https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-veggie-spring-rolls-with-peanut-sauce/)

**Ingredients**

* 10 rice paper sheets, 22 cm, round
* 1 large shallot, or sub a small onion
* 2 cups coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage & carrots)\*\*
* 2 cups broccoli slaw mix (julienne broccoli stems & carrots)\*\*
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 ½ tbsp soy sauce
* neutral oil (canola oil, veggie oil, etc)

\*\* You can use any crunchy veggies you want, some other options are lettuce, bean sprouts, and bok choy. The preshreded mixes make this recipe easier, but you can save money but shredding the veggies yourself!

*For Sauce:*

* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1 ½ tbsp soy sauce
* ½ tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp packed light brown sugar, optional
* ½ tbsp Sriracha, add more to taste as desired
* ½ tbsp lime juice
* 1 tsp freshly minced garlic
* ½ tsp grated ginger, or sub ¼ tsp powdered ginger
* ½ tbsp cornstarch

**Instructions**

1. Peel the shallot and thinly slice it across the short end, creating rings. Separate the rings with your hands.
2. Warm 1 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, for two minutes. Add the garlic, coleslaw mix, and broccoli slaw mix and cook, stirring frequently, for another minute, then add the soy sauce and cook for one more minute. Remove mixture from heat and transfer to a plate or bowl to cool. (You can jump ahead and prep the sauce for step 4 as the mixture cools, but don’t start the heat)
3. Once the mixture has cooled, make each spring roll one at a time. Prepare a wide bowl of water, large enough to dip the rice paper. Briefly dip the rice paper, turning it so every part touches the water. Place the rice paper on a clean, smooth surface and fill with ¼ cup of filling. Roll the spring roll (if you're unfamiliar with this technique, see the video on the website or google how to roll a spring roll). *\[The rice paper softens more overtime. If it feels rigid, wait a minute and try again. Try to make the rolls as tight and cylindrical as possible, wide/flat rolls don’t fry as nicely.\]*
4. Once the rolls are prepped, prepare the sauce. Combine the cornstarch with ¼ cup warm water and mix until dissolved. Combine this and all the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and place over low heat as you pan fry the spring rolls, mixing occasionally. If needed, add a splash of water to the sauce to maintain a silky consistency as it simmers.
5. Warm 2 tbsp of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Once hot, add 5 spring rolls (make sure they don’t touch, they will stick together). Pan fry the rolls, turning occasionally, until the outside is crispy, about 3 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat with the next 5 rolls, adding a little more oil if needed. Serve immediately with peanut sauce on the side.

The recipe above is from ATK.

Now, what I did slightly differently, but not differently enough to say *it's not the same anymore*:

- I found I needed more than a tsp of oil

- I only had serranos so I used them instead, and I used 3 of them with seeds instead of 1, because I love spicy

- I kept them in the oven til they started to blister and turn black in spots

- I already had a red onion sliced in the fridge, so I used that and added it along with the garlic to the pan later so it wouldn't burn due to them being sliced pretty thin"

This is my favorite marinade for baking salmon, which I love to do. Salmon is really easy and both over and undercooking isn't the end of the world, but the flavors from the soy-dijon combination are incredible. For additional tips, pictures and wit go to:

https://sauteed-onions.com/2017/07/17/soy-dijon-baked-salmon/

Ingredients

*  2 salmon fillets, about 1 pound
*  3 tablespoons of olive oil
*  1.5 tablespoons of high-quality soy sauce
*  1 tablespoon of dijon mustard
*  Pinch of salt and pepper to taste
*  Prep time – 25 minutes
*  Cook time – 25 minutes

Instructions

1. Start by whisking the olive oil, soy sauce and dijon mustard together in a small bowl, until emulsified. Lightly sprinkle salt and pepper over your salmon.

2. Place the salmon fillets in a small container, just large enough so that they can lay flat. Then pour 3/4 of your marinade over the salmon, reserving the rest for later. Cover the salmon and place in your refrigerator for at least 20 minutes. Since the marinade doesn’t contain any acids, which would essentially start cooking the salmon after a short while, you can leave it marinading overnight if you wanted to.

3. At this point, start pre-heating your oven to 375°, and oil up a baking sheet. Salmon has a tendency to infuriatingly stick to its cooking surface, and can get a bit messy if you don’t provide the proper amounts of oil. Take your fillets out of the marinade, allowing the excess to drip off, and place them skin-side down on the baking sheet. Place it in the oven, and bake for 25 minutes. Remove and pour over reserved marinade to taste.

4. Serve with additional marinade on the salmon, or on any side dishes you decide to pair it with. Salmon goes wonderfully with a green and grain, so feel free to use rice, couscous, broccoli, brussels, etc.

Update: Lots of people have asked about the brussels sprouts as well, and that's a really simple recipe:

Roasted Brussels Sprouts

*  1-1.5 pounds of brussels sprouts
*  3 tablespoons of olive oil
*  1 teaspoon of salt
*  1/2 teaspoon of pepper

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

2. Trim ends off of brussels sprouts, remove tough outer leaves and slice in half. Toss them in a big bowl with olive oil, salt and pepper until evenly coated.

3.  Spread out evenly on a baking sheet, /u/porradavfr is 100% right that you want a single layer and to give 'em space - that way they roast evenly and can caramelize deliciously. Roast for 35-40 minutes, or until they look fully browned. Check them every 10 minutes and give them a stir so they can brown all around.

Normally, brussels sprouts take on whatever flavor you add to them really well and I love to take advantage of that. However with this salmon, it's *so* flavor forward that I like a contrastingly simple brussels sprouts so I don't add anything else. "

Full recipe: [https://misterspiceguy.com/recipe/thai-green-curry-chicken-satay](https://misterspiceguy.com/recipe/thai-green-curry-chicken-satay)

**Ingredients for chicken satay:**

* 3 tbsp homemade green curry paste (or any other curry paste)
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 500g chicken fillet or thighs, cut into thin strips
* 1 tbsp palm sugar
* 1 tbsp fish sauce (nam pla)
* 150 ml coconut milk
* 2 tbsp lime juice‍

**Ingredients for satay sauce:**

* 1 heaped tbsp of green curry paste
* 1 tbsp of vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp of peanut butter (preferably crunchy)
* 4 tbsp of roasted peanuts, coarsely ground/chopped
* 150 ml coconut milk
* 1 tsp fish sauce
* 1 tbsp palm/regular sugar

**Directions:**

1. ‍The first step will be cutting up your chicken thighs in chunks of your preference. I personally like to make the cubes approximately 1cm x 1cm, because I don't like to grill the satay for to long. Most important is that you are consistent in the cutting size, so that your satay will cook evenly. Then put all the other satay ingredients in a bowl and give a whisk, add your chicken and put in the fridge for at least one hour but ideally overnight. If you are using wooden skewers, make sure you soak them in water to prevent burning on the BBQ.
2. ‍Now it's time to make the peanut-satay sauce. Start by heating up the vegetable oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Fry your curry paste for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. Then add all the other sauce ingredients and make sure you put it on your smallest burner on a real low heat. slowly simmer the sauce for about 5 minutes and your satay sauce will be finished. If you cook your satay sauce too long or on a high heat you will see that al the oil from the peanuts and the coconut milk separate and start floating on top, that is not what we are aiming for!
3. ‍Skew your chicken satay on the soaked skewers and now it's time to grill the satay. Ideally we do this on a BBQ but sometimes you want to make this dish in winter or you don't want to start a fire. In this case you can also use a griddle pan. Grill your satays on a medium-high heat and make sure you keep turning them often. After about 5 minutes of grilling (depending on your chunk size) your chicken satay will be ready to eat. Serve with the peanut sauce. Enjoy!"

**Cheesecake:**

* 1 cup (227g) pumpkin puree, from 1kg (2.2lb) pumpkin
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon grated fresh ginger
* ¼ teaspoon grated fresh nutmeg
* 2½ cups (250g) ginger nut biscuit crumbs
* 1 tablespoon (13g) packed light brown sugar
* 6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon sea salt, divided
* 24 ounces (680g) cream cheese, softened
* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
* ¾ cup (178 ml) heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs, room temperature

&#x200B;

1. If making pumpkin puree from scratch, slice pumpkin in half, scoop seeds out and place face down on baking pan. Roast in oven pre-heated at 190°C (375°F) for 45 minutes or until soft. Scrape flesh off and blend until smooth.
2. Place pumpkin puree (whether fresh or canned) in saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until the liquid has evaporated (roughly 10 minutes). Add ground cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to pumpkin puree and mix. Set aside.
3. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Get a roasting pan larger than the cake pan ready. Line bottom of 9 inch (23cm) springform pan with parchment paper. Cut 3 pieces of heavy-duty kitchen foil and put them in criss- cross on the work surface. Set springform pan in the middle and wrap the edges of the foil around the sides of the pan. This will prevent the water from the water bath seeping in.
4. Crush ginger nut biscuits in a ziploc bag or food processor, and mix with light brown sugar, melted butter and ½ teaspoon salt until crumbs are evenly moistened. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan with the bottom of a measuring cup or glass to make it compact. Bake for 10 minutes until set.
5. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese and granulated sugar until smooth (2 – 3 minutes with hand mixer). Add heavy cream, vanilla extract and ½ teaspoon salt.
6. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing until everything is combined.
7. Add ½ of cream cheese mixture to the spiced pumpkin puree from step #2.
8. Pour remaining plain cream cheese mixture onto the crust. Spoon pumpkin cream cheese mix over the top of plain cream cheese mixture. Place springform pan onto roasting pan.
9. Set the kettle on and pour boiling water onto the roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan, being careful that the water does not go above the kitchen foil and not to splash any water onto the cheesecake.
10. Bake for 50 – 55 minutes, until the centre barely jiggles when you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off, leaving the cheesecake in the oven, and prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon. Let the cheesecake cool for at least an hour.
11. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and from the water bath, and unwrap the foil. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it’s not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools further). Cover loosely with aluminium foil and chill the cheesecake in the refrigerator overnight.

**Caramel Pecan:**

* ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoons water
* 1½ tablespoons (25g) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2 tablespoon (30ml) double / heavy cream, room temperature
* ¼ teaspoon sea salt
* Optional spices: 1 stick cinnamon, 1 star anise
* ⅓ cup (40g) pecan, chopped roughly

&#x200B;

1. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add sugar to water. Stir with spatula to combine. Add cinnamon stick and star anise if using.
2. Let it cook, untouched, until sugar turns a copper colour (roughly 8 minutes).
3. Take caramel off heat and add butter. Swirl until caramel stops bubbling and becomes smooth.
4. Whisk in cream and salt, then add chopped pecans.
5. Allow to cool slightly then scoop over the borders of cheesecake."

* 3 Tbsp Chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing if you can)
* 2 Tbsp light soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp dark soy sauce

**Method**

1. Blanch whole pork belly for about 2-3 minutes. This gets rid of some bad taste and gives it more firmness for cutting. Let rest for 5 minutes.
2. Cut into cubes or thick chunks, whatever you prefer.
3. Blanch a second time. We are getting rid of even more excess fat, impurities and unpleasant taste notes. Remove and let rest until completely cool.
4. In a wok or cast iron pot on medium heat, add your oil and fry aromatics until fragrant. 
5. Return the belly, stir for a minute.
6. Cover with water, add sugar, cooking wine and soy sauces.
7. Simmer for 1 hour, lid on.
8. Take out the pork pieces (chopsticks are your friend here) and set aside. With a slotted spoon or small strainer remove all aromatics. Return pork.
9. Let the braising juice reduce until saucy, about 20-30 minutes. Don’t forget to stir occasionally when the sauce begins to thicken to prevent burning.
10. Serve with a warm bowl of rice and share ❤️ "

1. Cook der bacon in der skillet (use the same skillet the whole time for everything cos it's got FLAVAH). Cut cooked bacon into bits and set aside, leave the delicious grease in your pan.

2. Sautee the jalapenos, onions, and garlic in the bacon grease with some olive oil and whatever seasoning you feel like. Set aside when done, but still don’t clean the skillet.

3. Bring a pot of really really salty water to a boil. Like, a tablespoon or more of salt. I just do it til it feels right.

4. Add macaroni and boil until done. You can throw a bay leaf or two in as well - I forgot to.

5. In a large bowl, mix together the softened cream cheese, then the grated cheeses (freshly grated, it’s essential!!!)

6. In your skillet, add unsalted butter and heat over medium heat until melted. Once melted, whisk in all-purpose flour and cook for 1 minute while stirring often. Gradually pour in whole milk while whisking constantly.

7. Once thickened, add in the mixed grated cheeses (1 cup-ish at a time) and whisk until melted and combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper +/- other seasonings .

8. Drain macaroni and pour into the cheese sauce and...ummm [fold together. You fold it in.](https://youtu.be/NywzrUJnmTo) Coat  all of dem noodles thoroughly.

9. Add back in your sauteed veggies from earlier, as well as the bacon bits, and fresh thyme +/- other herbs and season to taste.

* 1 large green tomato cored and quartered
* 4 tomatillos husks removed, tomatillos washed and quartered
* 1 Serrano pepper trimmed and halved
* 2 cups chicken stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

InstructionsPrepare the Tomatoes:

* Place the tomato rounds on a paper towel lined plate. Season all over with a bit of sea salt. Place more paper towels on top to absorb excess moisture. Set aside until needed.

Cook the Chicken:

* Preheat oven to 425ºF. Heat the neutral cooking oil in the skillet over medium-high until very hot. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.

* Remove the chicken from the oven and carefully return the skillet to the stovetop. Transfer the chicken to a platter and keep warm.

Prepare the Green Tomato Salsa Verde:

* While the chicken is cooking, prepare the green tomato salsa verde.
* Heat a teaspoon of oil in a saucepan and add the shallot. Cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds.
* Add the tomatillos, quartered green tomato, Serrano pepper, and the chicken stock.Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
* Using an immersion blender or food processor, pulse the mixture until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

Fry the Tomatoes:

* Carefully drain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat in the skillet.
* Turn the heat on the skillet to medium high. Add the butter.
* Once melted and frothy, pat the tomatoes dry once more and place into the skillet and cook without moving for 2-3 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to char. Flip and cook an additional 1-3 minutes. Add the sliced Serrano pepper, if using, and cook for 45 seconds. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the warm salsa verde between shallow plates and place a tomato round on top. Place a chicken thigh on each dish and scatter the sliced Serrano pepper on top, if using. Enjoy!

* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
* 2 teaspoons drained capers

#### Prepare salmon:

#### Cook the potatoes:

* Add the potatoes to a pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes until fork tender. Drain and then transfer the potatoes back to the same pot and cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes to cook off the excess water. Carefully cut the potatoes in half.

**SEASONINGS:**

* 2.5 tbs Thai red chili paste
* 1.5 tbs sugar, 6-7 tbs fresh lime juice
* 3 tbs fish sauce
* 40ml evaporated milk 
* Adjust the ratio accordingly, due to the different level of saltiness and sweetness of the chili paste & fish sauce

**NOTE:**

* If you are lactose intolerant and still would like to have a little bit of creaminess in the soup, you can use coconut milk or other plant milk. However, they will impart some different flavours in this soup. Or, you can just skip the milk!
* The herbs are used to add flavours in the soup. Don't eat them as they are very fibrous! 

**STEPS:**

* Remove heads and shells of the prawn, then devein them.
* Cut squid into bite sized pieces
* Optional: to make them look nicer, make shallow crisscross cuts on the inside of the squid pieces.
* In a pot, add 1tbs of oil, fry the heads and shells, press them using a potato smasher to further extract the juice from the heads.
* Add 1 litre of water and let simmer on low heat for 25 minutes
* Use the back of the knife to bruise lemongrass stalks, then slice them diagonally
* Slice galangal/blue ginger into thick slices
* Slightly break up/tear the kaffir lime leaves
* Bruise chili and cut them into halves
* Slice shallot into small wedges
* Slice tomato into chunks

* Add milk, make sure to use low heat. When everything is cooked, taste and check the level of saltiness and sweetness. Remove from heat.
* Keep stirring gently to slightly bring down the temperature of the soup, then add lime juice and mix well. Always add lime juice last, otherwise it will turn bitter if cooked.
* Serve hot, garnish with cilantro. It can be eaten on its own, or with steamed Jasmine rice. Enjoy!

**Ingredients**

• ¼ of a large cauliflower (about ½ of a small one)

• 1 grapefruit

• 1 orange

• 1 shallot

• ½ lime

• 1 - 3 tsps honey

• ½ pomegranate, for the seeds

• fresh mint (a few small leaves)

• red chili flakes

• poppy seeds

• olive oil

• salt

• pepper

&#x200B;

**Directions**

*For the cauliflower:*

1. Cut straight down through the centre of your cauliflower, then cut again so as to get a steak-like slice roughly 1cm (a bit less than half an inch) in thickness – repeat twice to get 3 slices total.
2. Remove the stem from each “steak” and separate the florets, allowing for chunks of varying sizes.
3. In a large frying pan on medium-high heat, add a small amount of olive oil, then rub in each piece of cauliflower one by one so as to thinly coat them with the oil. Sprinkle with some salt and pepper, let cook without disturbing until golden (but not brown), then flip and season again, leaving the florets alone to cook until golden on their other side. This’ll take approximately 5-6 minutes per side.
4. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the cauliflower to rest until you’re ready to assemble the salad.

*For the citrus:*

1. Cut a tiny bit off the top and bottom of the orange, then use a knife to carefully cut off its peel and pith. Do not discard the peels. Once your orange is naked, you may cut it across its width into slices about as thick as the cauliflower slices.
2. Repeat with the grapefruit.

*For the dressing:*

1. Slice the shallot across its width as thinly as you can.
2. Transfer it to a mug or small bowl, then squeeze over it the juice of your ½ lime plus whatever juice you can squeeze out of your orange and grapefruit scraps. Sprinkle in some salt and give everything a stir, allowing the acid and salt to mellow the shallot a bit.
3. Add in 1 to 3 teaspoons of honey, depending on how sour or sweet you’d like things to be, and as much freshly cracked pepper as you’d like.
4. Pour in approximately 2 teaspoons to 1 Tablespoon of olive oil (again, this depends on how much you like acidity – use less if you like things a bit sharp, more if you prefer things a bit rounded). Stir, loosening rings of shallot as you go, and set aside.

*For the assembly:*

1. Layer the citrus slices and cauliflower slices however you please on a plate, then pour on enough of the lime dressing (with the shallot rings) to coat generously coat everything.
2. Top with pomegranate seeds, poppy seeds, red chili flakes, fresh mint leaves and salt and pepper.
3. Enjoy!

https://www.recipetineats.com/juicy-cuban-mojo-pork-roast-chef-movie-recipe/

Only thing i did differently was bake the pork on oranges because I didn't have onions. 

Ingredients

MARINADE

3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

1 cup cilantro / coriander, lightly packed

1 tbsp orange zest

3/4 cup orange juice, fresh

1/2 cup lime juice

1/4 cup mint leaves, lightly packed

8 garlic cloves

1 tbsp fresh oregano leaves, packed (or 1/2 tbsp dried oregano)

2 tsp ground cumin

1 tsp salt

1 tsp black pepper

PORK

4 lb / 2 kg pork shoulder, skinless and boneless

MOJO SAUCE

2 tbsp lime juice

1/4 cup orange juice

Salt and pepper

Instructions

Combine Marinade ingredients in a food processor and blend until the herbs and garlic are finely chopped. Alternatively, you can finely chop/mince the garlic and herbs then mix all ingredients in a bowl.

Place in a large ziplock bag with the pork. Place in the fridge overnight (in a bowl, just to be safe).

Remove the pork from the Marinade and bring to room temperature. Reserve the Marinade.

Preheat oven to 170C/325F.

Place the pork on a rack in a roasting dish (or on a couple of onions have, to elevate the pork). Cover with a lid or double layer or foil, slightly tented so it is not pressed tightly against the pork.

Place in the oven and bake for 2 hrs 30 minutes. Then remove the foil and return to the oven for a further 30 minutes to brown. (See Note 1 for original roasting direction and times)

Remove from the oven and place on a plate, loosely covered with foil. Rest for 20 minutes before serving with the Mojo Sauce on the side. I decorated mine with pan fried slices of oranges and extra cilantro/coriander leaves.

MOJO SAUCE

Place the reserved Marinade, Mojo Sauce ingredients and 2 tbsp of the roasting pan drippings into a small saucepan. Bring to boil and add salt and pepper to taste. You might also want to add more lime juice or even a touch of sugar. Turn the heat down and simmer for 1 minute, then remove from the stove and set aside."

Calories: 782kcal

Equipment

* Large pot
* Wide skillet

Ingredients

* 16 ounces fettuccine
* 2 teaspoons neutral frying oil
* 1 pound hot Italian sausage loose
* 1 shallot peeled and sliced
* 1 leek trimmed, washed, and sliced into half-moons
* 10 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed, scrubbed, and thinly sliced
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 cup white wine or chicken stock
* 1/2 cup chicken stock
* 15 ounce can fire-roasted tomatoes
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley minced

InstructionsStart the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fettuccine until al dente. Remove 3/4 cup of the pasta cooking water from the pot. Drain the pasta and set aside. *\*Note, if you time it right, the pasta should be done as the sauce finishes simmering. If possible, simply using a spider strainer to transfer the cooked pasta directly to the sauce.*

Start the Sauce:

* Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, for 10-13 minutes until mostly cooked through and beginning to crisp up around the edges.
* Add the sliced shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until it begins to soften. After the shallot softens, add the sliced leeks and cook an additional 5-6 minutes until it softens.
* Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms soften and begin to brown. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper.

Simmer the Sauce:

* Melt the butter into the skillet. Once it is melted and frothy, add the white wine, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add the chicken stock and tomatoes. Simmer for 30 minutes, adding more liquid (water or stock) as necessary if the sauce becomes too thick or sticks to the skillet.

Sauce the Pasta:

* Transfer the cooked fettuccine and the minced parsley to the skillet along with the reserved pasta cooking water and toss to coat until the pasta is glossy and well-coated.

\* 1lime juice to drizzle before serving

\* fish sauce to your preference

&#x200B;

**How to prepare Massaman Curry:**

**1.** Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Add 2 diced shallots and fry until they start to brown.

**2.** Turn up the heat and add 400g of diced chicken thighs to the pan. Sear the meat until browned on all sides.

**3.** Add 1 teaspoon each of ground cumin and ground coriander, along with 2 sliced carrots. Mix everything together and cook for 2 more minutes.

**4.** Add 4 tablespoons of Thai red curry paste, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 400g of halved waxy potatoes to the pan.

**5.** Serve the curry over jasmine rice and top with toasted peanuts, fresh coriander, and a drizzle of lime juice.

&#x200B;

**Cooking Tips for Massaman Curry:**

Use high-quality ingredients - Massaman curry relies on the flavour of the curry paste, so make sure to use a good-quality one.

Toast the spices - Toasting the spices, such as cinnamon, cumin, and coriander, before adding them to the curry will enhance their flavour and aroma.

Brown the meat - If you're using meat, such as beef or chicken, brown it first to seal in the juices and enhance the flavour.

Use coconut cream - Coconut cream is richer and thicker than coconut milk, and it gives the curry a creamy texture and flavour.

Add peanuts - Traditional massaman curry often includes peanuts, which add a crunchy texture and nutty flavour to the dish. You can also use cashews or almonds.

Don't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.

Adjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours."

* 3 tbsp oil
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 onion
* Fresh ginger to taste (I used about 20 g)
* 1 tsp tomato paste
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp turmeric
* 2 tsp cilantro (powdered)
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 3 tsp lemon juice
* 3 tomatoes
* 500 ml coconut milk
* 2 tsp Garam Masala
* 400-500 g salmon fillet

(I encourage you to vary the amount of spices to your taste, this is how I did it and it turned out very flavorful)

**Instructions**

1. Peel and mince the garlic, chop the onion finely. Peel and chop the ginger, set aside separately. Dice the tomatoes. Cut the salmon into cubes.
2. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the minced garlic and chopped onion. When the onion starts to turn transparent, add the fresh ginger and tomato paste. Reduce heat a little, add the turmeric, cilantro powder, cayenne pepper and salt, fry carefully. Deglaze with the lemon juice.
3. Add tomatoes, turn the heat back up and stir for a few minutes. Pour in the coconut milk, bring to a boil and add Garam Masala (Garam Masala burns easily, hence add after liquid)
4. Add the salmon, bring to a boil again then reduce heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes depending on the cube size.
5. Serve over rice and garnish with chives and chili flakes.

The recipe is easily adjustable, you can add veggie (e.g. thinly sliced carrots, mushroom, zucchini) or fruits (e.g. pineapple, mango, apple) after the tomatoes and follow the rest."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fed06l,https://i.redd.it/yml834irt1l41.jpg,reddit," I've made the traditional version for years, but recently have changed some techniques to come up with an aglio e olio e peperoncin I like even more.

Two main differences from a more traditional version:

* ***Roasted Garlic & Fresh Garlic***
   * As Kenji Lopez discusses in the Food Lab, he makes his garlic and oil pasta with grated, sliced, and whole clove garlic pieces. Another great garlic preparation is roasted whole which caramelizes and becomes sweet. I like to combine both freshly grated and roasted whole head of garlic. The roasted garlic can be made into a paste to create a seamless sauce.
* ***Use Olive AND Butter***
   * For aglio e olio, the sauce is made by forming an emulsion between pasta water and the olive oil which can be tricky since water and oil do not naturally want to mix. To make this emulsion easier, use a mix of olive oil and butter (Another tip from the Food Lab). Why butter? Well, in reading Ratio by Michael Ruhlman we find that butter is already an emulsion as it contains around 15% water. So not only does it provide flavor, but it also lends a helping hand in sauce construction. It helps the starchy pasta water and the olive oil come together for a quick sauce.

# RECIPE

**Roasted Garlic:**

* 1 whole head of garlic
* Coarse kosher salt
* Fresh ground pepper
* Drizzle of olive oil

**Aglio e Olio:**

* 30 g salt for the pasta water (1% solution)
* 1 lb dry spaghetti (preferably bronze cut)
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* Large pinch red pepper flakes
* Whole head roasted garlic ( ingredients above)
* 3 cloves of minced or grated fresh garlic
* 3 TBSP unsalted butter
* 1 cup reserved pasta water
* Large handful minced parsley (at least 1/2 cup)
* Coarse kosher salt and fresh ground pepper to taste

 **Method:**

1. Prepare the roasted garlic. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the top fourth off the head of garlic. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Wrap in aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Let cool, and squeeze out the roasted garlic. **Note: This can be made ahead of time and stored (3-4 days) in the fridge to make this dish come together even faster.**
2. Bring 3 quarts / liters of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 30 grams of salt or about 1.5 TBSP if using Morton's coarse kosher salt. Once the water has boiled, add the pasta and set a timer for 1-2 minutes less than the package says. Make sure to stir the pasta a few times in the first minutes to avoid sticking.
3. While the water is coming to a boil, prepare your mise en place for the olive oil, pepper flakes, roasted garlic, fresh garlic, butter, and parsley.
4. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pepper flakes, roasted garlic, and minced garlic and saute stirring constantly for 45 seconds. Be careful not to burn. Turn off the heat, add in the butter, and set the sauce aside.
5. When the pasta is done, scoop off 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta.
6. Set the sauce over medium-low heat. Add in the pasta, a 1/4 cup of the pasta water. Stir vigorously until the sauce comes together and begins to coat the spaghetti. Add extra pasta water if needed. Stir in the parsley. **Taste it. Season with salt as needed and serve right away.** Top with fresh Parmigiano (optional)."

Written recipe:

- 50 grams frozen peas
- 2 tablespoon Mirin (for slight sweetness)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3 tablespoon soy sauce
- 4 stalks of spring onions (to cook and to garnish)
- 1 tablespoon ginger, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 3 eggs, pre-whisked
- 6 slices of bacon
- 250 grams white jasmine rice

Start off by cooking your bacon on a cast iron pan, you want enough fat left over on the pan to fry your rice in. 

Afterwards, fry the garlic and ginger, then add the peas, followed by the rice. 

Note: I used a rice cooker so the cooking time for this amount of rice was about 12-15 minutes. So cook your rice before everything!

Incorporate the garlic, ginger and peas with the rice and then add in about 3 tablespoons of soy sauce. Mix well until the rice has taken a nice brown colour.

Then add in the rest of your wet ingredients, which is 1 teaspoon of sesame sauce, and 2 tablespoons of mirin.

Mix well then add in 3 beaten eggs. Traditionally you’d fry the eggs separately and add it in later, but I find that cooking the eggs in with the rice creates a nice fluffiness. 

Then afterwards add in 4 spring onions finely chopped and you’re done!"

Ingredients

For the Shrimp Stock (see note):

2 pounds (900g) shell-on shrimp, or 3 pounds (1.4kg) head-on shrimp (small or large shrimp will work in this recipe; size doesn't matter)

2 teaspoons (8g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable or canola oil

1 medium yellow onion, diced

2 large ribs celery, diced

4 medium cloves garlic, smashed

2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste

1/2 cup (120ml) dry sherry or brandy (optional)

1 bay leaf

A few sprigs flat-leaf parsley

4 sprigs thyme

For the Étouffée:

1/2 cup (4 ounces; 115g) unsalted butter

1/2 cup (2 1/4 ounces; 65g) all-purpose flour

1 (8-ounce; 225g) medium yellow onion, diced

2 large ribs celery (6 ounces; 170g), diced

1 (8-ounce; 225g) large green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced (or, if you want a sweeter flavor, half of a large green bell pepper and half of a large red bell pepper)

4 medium cloves garlic, coarsely chopped

3 scallions, white and light-green parts only, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish

1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1/4 teaspoon onion powder

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1/8 teaspoon hot paprika (optional)

3 cups (700ml) shrimp stock, plus more as needed

2 bay leaves

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Warm long-grain rice, for serving

Directions

1.

For the Shrimp Stock (see note): Peel and devein shrimp, reserving the shrimp shells; if using head-on shrimp, twist off the heads and reserve with the shells. In a medium bowl, combine peeled shrimp with the 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and stir well. Refrigerate shrimp until it's time to add them to the étouffée.

2.

In a heavy-bottomed stockpot or Dutch oven, heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp shells and heads (if using) and cook, stirring constantly and scraping up any browned bits as they form on the bottom of the pot, until it becomes difficult to remove the browned bits and it seems they could start to burn, about 4 minutes; lower heat at any point if necessary to avoid burning.

3.

Add onion, celery, and garlic and continue to cook, stirring and scraping, until softened. Add tomato paste and stir well until incorporated. If using sherry or brandy, add it to the pot and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits, then add 2 quarts (1.9L) water. (If not using sherry or brandy, just add the water right away.)

4.

Add bay leaf, parsley, and thyme and bring to a gentle simmer, then cook for 45 minutes. Strain stock; do not skim the oil from the surface of the stock, as the oil contains a lot of the shrimp flavor and won't be a problem for the étouffée.

5.

For the Étouffée: In a Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add flour and stir to form a smooth paste. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom very frequently, until roux turns the color of your choice: light tan, peanut butter–colored, or chocolaty brown. The color of the roux will change the flavor of the étouffée, from mild and light with a sweet shrimp flavor for a blond roux, to dark, slightly bitter, and complex for a darker brown one.

6.

Add onion, celery, and bell pepper, then lower heat to medium and cook, stirring, until vegetables are coated in the floury paste and have softened slightly, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and scallion and cook for 1 minute.

7.

Stir in dried oregano, dried thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and hot paprika, if using.

8.

Add the shrimp stock in ladlefuls, stirring well to incorporate between additions. At first the stock will form a thick, gluey paste with the flour, but it will eventually thicken into a thick sauce. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain a bare simmer.

9.

Add bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, then cover and simmer, occasionally stirring and scraping the bottom to prevent scorching, until vegetables are very soft, about 30 minutes.

10.

Stir in shrimp and cook until they have just turned pink and are cooked through; the amount of time this takes will depend on the size of the shrimp. At this point, if the étouffée is too thick for your taste, add more stock as needed to thin it to your desired consistency.

11.

Season étouffée with salt and pepper. Spoon into bowls or onto plates with warm rice. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and serve"

* 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* ½ cup roasted red bell peppers, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
* ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste
* 1 cup arborio, carnaroli, or any short-grain white rice
* ¼ cup white wine
* 3 cups water or chicken stock
* ½ cup freshly grated parm
* Salt and pepper
* Fresh basil, for serving

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Pat chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium-high. Once shimmering, add the chicken—skin-side down—and cook without moving for 5-6 minutes. Once the chicken skin is golden-brown, flip and cook for 2 minutes more. Transfer chicken to a plate. Leave any fat in the pot and turn the heat to medium.

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Add the onion to the pot and cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-9 minutes until golden brown. Adjust heat as needed.
2. Add the roasted red peppers, garlic, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute.

**Cook the rice:**

1. Add the rice to the pot and toss to coat. Season with salt. Cook for 1 minute until it begins to toast lightly.
2. Pour in the wine and bring it to a boil. Cook for 1–2 minutes.

**Simmer the rice:**

1. Add water or chicken stock and bring to a boil. Place chicken on top, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20–25 minutes.
2. Turn the heat to medium and partially remove the lid (the pot should be half-covered). Rapid simmer for  5 minutes. Check the internal temperature of the chicken and ensure it’s 165°F. Once the temperature is reached, transfer the chicken to a plate.

**Finish the rice:**

1. Turn the heat on the rice to medium-low and stir regularly. Continue simmering and stirring to cook off any excess liquid if needed. Stir in the parmesan and simmer for 5-7 minutes or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Consistency should be creamy, not soupy! Add salt if needed.

**Broil the chicken:**

1. If you like, you can place chicken on top and broil for 3-5 mins to crisp up the skin again!

**To serve:**

1. Sprinkle a few basil leaves on top of the pot. Serve the rice with a chicken thigh on top and enjoy!"

**Ingredients**

2 cups (454g) lukewarm water

1 tablespoon (12g) sugar

1 tablespoon (9g) active dry yeast or instant yeast, or 1 packet active dry yeast

1 tablespoon (18g) salt

2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil, optional

5 1/2 to 6 cups (660g to 720g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or Pizza Flour Blend, enough to make a soft, smooth dough

2 tablespoons (12g) Pizza Dough Flavor, optional

**Instructions**

Dissolve the sugar, yeast, and salt in the lukewarm water (and olive oil, if you're using it).

Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1/2 cups flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.

Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.

Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12"" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.

Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.

Preheat your oven to 450°F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. Some possibilities include sliced pepperoni; sautéed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; cooked meats; olives; anchovies; and grated or shredded cheese.

Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.

Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.

Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/i7t6jv,https://i.redd.it/v5gi9cfczdg51.jpg,reddit,"# INGREDIENTS
1 recipe for Pressure Cooker Chickpeas (about 3 cups), drained and rinsed, or 2 (14-ounce) cans

2/3 cup tahini, more as needed

1 pinch lemon zest

1/4 cup lemon juice, plus more as needed, (from about 1 lemon)

1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste 

1 teaspoon garlic, roughly chopped (2 cloves)

1/2 cup ice water, or less

## optional toppings

extra-virgin olive oil

handful of cooked chickpeas

toasted pine nuts

sumac or ground cumin

ground Aleppo pepper

fresh parsley, finely chopped
# METHOD
Start the recipe for Pressure Cook Chickpeas or warm the drained canned chickpeas with some water on your stove. Warming the chickpeas makes them softer and will blend better for a very smooth hummus. Set aside a handful of chickpeas for garnish, if using.

Drain and immediately pour the warmed chickpeas into a food processor. Blend them until a smooth paste forms. Add the tahini, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt and garlic into the blended chickpea mixture and continue to blend for about a minute, making sure there’s no bits of garlic. 

Now, with machine running, pour in the ice water a little at a time using the feed tube. You should notice that the hummus becomes lighter in color and the hummus is very smooth. Continue to let the food processor run and stop adding the water when you are happy with consistency (you may not use all of the water). Taste the hummus and adjust accordingly, adding more salt or lemon, as desired.

## TO SERVE 

Spoon the hummus unto a large plate. Then use the back of the spoon to swirl the hummus towards the center of the plate. Press the spoon a little deeper leaving the outer edge and the center a little higher to create a little gully for the olive oil to pool. Drizzle a little olive oil over the hummus and sprinkle the edges with sumac (or cumin and Aleppo pepper). Whole chickpeas, pine nuts, or parsley may also be added. Hummus is best served at room temperature, but may be stored in the refrigerator for another time.

The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.

Fun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;

When she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel…and so was born the Tortellini.

* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil
* salt

&#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced
* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter
* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs
* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)
* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours

Now let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour

* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.
* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.
* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.
* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part
* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough
* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness
* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process
* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video
* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.
* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer
* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.
* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section

That's all if you have any question feel free to ask and Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas  in advance \^\_\^"

* Egg Yolk 2  
  
* Butter 40g  
  
* Salt 0.5 tsp  
  
Cinnamon Sugar Ingredients:  
  
* Cinnamon 1 tsp  
  
* Sugar 1/4 cup  
  
Recipe:  
  
1. Mix Sugar, Milk & Yeast until sugar is dissolved, wait for it to show life  
  
2. Add Yeast mixture, 2 egg yolks, and bread flour to a mixing bowl  
  
3. Knead until dough is whole and not sticky  
  
4. Add Butter & Salt, knead for 10 minutes (until passes window pane test)  
  
5. Divide dough, 36g balls (for medium size donuts)  
  
6. Make each 36g into a taught ball, pinch the seams  
  
7. Let it rise for 30 min  
  
8. Flatten the balls a bit, use a ring to make holes in the flattened balls (save the holes for frying too!)  
  
9. Let it rise a second time for 20 min  
  
10. Fry in low heat flipping once once golden brown

Tips  
  
* Dust the surface your working in with flour before making the balls, makes it easier to lift the donuts to the fryer  
  
* 36g was a sweet spot for me in terms of size, 40g was a bit too big  
  
* if you mishandled the donuts while cutting the holes or while anything really, and make dents, do not worry. The frying will fill out any imperfections as the bubbles fill it up  
  
* cinnamon sugar really is the easiest topping and really warms you up too! Especially if you eat the donut while it's still warm.

[Video Recipe for Step-by-Step Instruction](https://youtu.be/BIdCbKXbeLQ)

**Ingredients**: 

*cake layer*:

* 1/2 stick butter (\~60g)
* 1/3 cup sugar (\~70g)
* 1/4 cup honey (\~80g) 
* 2 eggs, cold & beaten
* 1tsp baking soda  (\~5g) 
* 2 cups flour, loosely packed (\~250g) 

*frosting*:

* 1/3 cup sour cream (\~80g)
* 1 cup heavy cream (\~240g)
* 1/4 cup sugar (\~50g)

**Instruction**:

1. Combine butter, honey, sugar. Heat until melted and bubbling. 
2. Add baking soda. Cook until darkened. 
3. Whisk in beaten eggs.
4. Mix in the flour, half at a time. 
5. Transfer dough to a baking sheet. 
6. Roll into one large rectangular dough sheet.
7. Poke with a fork and bake at 375F for 7min.
8. Whip up sour cream, heavy cream, and sugar, into stiff peak.
9. Cut dough sheet in half, stack it over the other half; trim them even. 
10. Cut the double sheet into 3rds, so that you have a total of 6 layers; trim them even.
11. Cut up the trimming and toss them back into the oven for 5 more min, or until crispy.
12. Spread the 6 layers into 1 single sheet; frost with whipped cream.
13. Pick up the layers one at a time, and stack them up. 
14. Frost the sides with more whipped cream. 
15. (optional) grind the crispy trimming in a food processor. stick the crumbs onto the sides, or use as a topping.

My parents came to visit and I wanted to bake something quick for them. The cake I made last night amd the topping this morning.

Tip: for a faster cake use whiped cream. The topping in this recipe is great, but just whipped cream with a slice is also very nice. 

FOR THE CAKE:
- 250 millilitres guinness
- 250 grams unsalted butter
- 75 grams cocoa powder
- 400 grams caster sugar
- 150 millilitres sour cream
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 275 grams plain flour
- 2½ teaspoons bicarbonate of soda

FOR THE TOPPING:
- 300 grams cream cheese
- 150 grams icing sugar
- 2 teaspoons cornflour
- 125 millilitres double cream (or whipping cream)

METHOD:
1. Preheat the oven to gas mark 4/180°C/160°C Fan/350ºF, and butter and line a 23cm / 9 inch springform tin.

2. Pour the Guinness into a large wide saucepan, add the butter - in spoons or slices - and heat until the butter's melted, at which time you should whisk in the cocoa and sugar. Beat the sour cream with the eggs and vanilla and then pour into the brown, buttery, beery pan and finally whisk in the flour and bicarb.

3. Pour the cake batter into the greased and lined tin and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Leave to cool completely in the tin on a cooling rack, as it is quite a damp cake.

4. When the cake's cold, sit it on a flat platter or cake stand and get on with the icing. Lightly whip the cream cheese until smooth, sieve over the icing sugar and cornflour and then beat to combine.

5. If using double cream, add it and beat until you have a spreadable consistency. If using whipping cream, whisk first to soft peaks, add a couple of spoonfuls into the cream cheese mixture and once this is combined, fold in the rest.

6. Ice the top of the black cake so that it resembles the frothy top of the famous pint."

**How to prepare Butter Chicken:**

**1.** To prepare butter chicken masala, marinate diced chicken overnight in the fridge or for at least 1 hour outside of the fridge.

**2.** Heat oil or ghee in a non-stick frying pan over high heat and pan-fry chicken pieces in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Get some nice browning on the chicken and scrape any bits that get stuck. Keep the chicken in a separate pot for later use.

**3.** In the same frying pan, reduce heat to medium and melt butter or ghee. Add finely diced onions with 1 tsp of salt and sweat until translucent for about 10 minutes. Next, add minced ginger and garlic followed by the remaining spice blend and any remaining chicken marinade. Increase the heat slightly and cook until fragrant for about 2 minutes.

**4.** Add chopped tomatoes to the pan and combine, then pour in double cream. Blend the sauce with an immersion blender. Add chicken and mango chutney to the sauce and bring it up to a simmer. Continue cooking for 10 minutes, and season to your taste with salt  if needed.

**5.** When ready, serve the dish garnished with fresh coriander. You can enjoy it with cucumber raita, naan bread and basmati rice.

This deep-fried pastry is definitely one of my favourite sweets from childhood usually prepared by my dear grandmother. Sometimes made on special occasions like Fat Thursday or on a rainy day to make it a little bit brighter. They are also called ""Chrust"" meaning wooden twigs resembling their fragileness and texture.

**Ingredients:**

* 400g (14.1oz) of sieved pastry flour
* 6tbsp of sour cream
* 6 egg yolks
* 2tbsp of 95% alcohol (40% minimum)
* pinch of salt
* 1L (1quart) of oil for deep frying
* icing sugar for dusting

**Method:**

1.In the bowl mix flour, salt, cream, yolks, alcohol and by using a spatula.

2. Once wet and dry ingredients combine, bring it to a ball shape with your hands (you may need to add a little bit more cream if it looks to dry).

3. The dough will be too hard to knead by hands, we gonna use a rolling pin beating method. Hit the dough with a rolling pin until flat and then turn on the other side and fold. Do this for around 10 minutes until the dough looks smooth.

4. Once ready, rest the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes (you can wrap it to prevent drying).

5. Next, divide the dough into 4 parts, roll each part as thin as possible to get the best crunch (I have not used any flour for rolling)

6. Cut rolled dough vertically to get equal strings (3,5cm thick (1.4inch)) you can use a wheel cutter or a knife to do so.

7. Cut each string into 2-3 equal pieces (10-15cm long (4-6inch)) cuts can be made at an angle so the Faworki looks the best. In each piece cut a hole (3-4cm (1.2-1.6inch)).

8. To finish put one end of the piece inside the hole and pull through, this will give you their final shape. Place covered on the cloth to prevent from frying, ready for the deep frying.

9. To deep-fry heat the oil to 200C (392F) and fry few at the time flipping upside down with a fork to cook on both sides until golden brown. When ready place on the kitchen towel to remove excess fat and cool on a rack. Dust with icing sugar before serving.

**Insight:**

* When the pastry hits the hot oil alcohol evaporates quickly preventing the dough from absorbing the oil giving you crunchy and healthier product.
* This recipe originated in the ancient times of the Roman Empire and can be found across Europe in different variations.

## Ingredients

## For the pastry

* 2.5 cups flour
* Pinch of salt
* 200g chilled stick of salted butter
* 6 - 8 tablespoons icy cold water
* 1 tablespoon caster sugar
* 1 egg yolk for brushing the pastry

## For the filling

* 400g strawberries roughly sliced or cut in half
* 1 tablespoon caster sugar
* 1/2 tablespoon corn flour
* 1 tablespoon port
* Zest of 1 lemon
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Method

## To make the pastry

* Chill a large bowl, grater and stick of butter in the freezer for 20 minutes.
* Combine your flour and salt in the chilled bowl and whisk together. Grate your butter and add to the flour breaking the butter down with your fingertips until you have a pebble like crumbly texture.
* Create a well in the centre of your flour and pour in your icy cold water. Use a fork to bring your dough together. Do your best to moisten most of your dough so it is moist and shaggy.
* Lightly dust your kitchen bench with flour and knead your dough into a disc shape. Cut your dough in half, wrap each piece in glad wrap and leave to sit overnight or for a minimum of one hour in the fridge. You will only need half of this dough mixture to make the galette so keep the other half in the freezer for the next time you want to make this!

## To make the filling

* Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celcius
* Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and leave to sit for 5 minutes to allow for the juices to release.
* Take one disc of dough out of the fridge and sprinkle your kitchen bench with flour. With a rolling pin, roll your dough out to a large circle about 4mm thick. Place your dough onto a flat baking tray with baking paper.
* Leaving a 4cm boarder around the edge of the dough, pour in your strawberry mixture.
* Fold in the overhanging pastry pinching some of the dough together to create a rustic circle shape.
* Whisk your egg yolk, add in a splash of water and brush the edges of your dough with it. This will help create a lovely golden colour when cooking.
* Place your galette into the oven for 30 minutes. Leave to rest for 15 minutes until serving so the juices can solidify. Serve immediately."

# Equipment

* Instant Pot (8 qt)

# Ingredients

* 3 lbs boneless beef shank (cut into 1.5 inch cubes)
* 2 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 slices ginger
* 1 yellow onion (chopped into wedges)
* 6 cloves garlic (smashed)
* 2 dried red chili
* 2 stalks scallion (chopped into 3 inch segments)
* ¼ cup light soy sauce
* ¼ cup Shaoxing wine
* 2 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoon chili bean sauce (*doubanjiang*)
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 8 cups water

**Aromatics**

* 2 bay leaves
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 4 star anise
* ¼ teaspoon five spice powder
* 1 dried orange peel

**Remainder of Ingredients**

* 900 g thick wheat noodle
* Bok choy
* Scallions (chopped)
* Pickled potherb mustard (optional)

# Instructions

1. Prep beef shank by chopping into 1.5 inch cubes.
2. Boil water in a large pot. Add beef shank to pot and allow the water to come back to a boil. Once it's reached boiling point again, let simmer for 1 minute. This is to help remove any impurities from the meat.
3. Drain pot and rinse meat with fresh cool water to remove any remaining impurities. Set aside in a colander.
4. Heat a wok up to medium-high heat and add neutral oil. Sauté garlic, ginger, dry chili pepper, onion and scallion until the onion is translucent.
5. Add soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, spicy bean paste, tomato paste, and sugar. Stir frequently until the sauce begins to bubble.
6. Add sauce to Instant Pot with the meat. Then, add 8 cups of water. Ensure you are not exceeding the maximum line indicated on the pot insert.
7. Add aromatics. Close lid and click Meat/Stew option. Set timer for 60 minutes. If you do not have Meat/Stew option, set pressure to High and timer to 60 minutes. The Instant Pot will take at least 30-40 minutes to build up pressure before it starts the cooking time.
8. Allow Instant Pot to do a Natural Release which may run another 40 minutes to an hour. You can press the button to do a Rapid Release, but doing so runs the risk of drying the meat out.
9. Boil a pot of water and cook noodles according to package. Remove from water but do not turn off the heat. Add bok choy into the noodle water and blanch for 60 seconds.
10. Assemble by splitting the noodles into 4 separate bowls, then spooning in the broth and meat. Top each serving with bok choy, chopped scallions, and optional pickled mustard greens."

* 4 boneless, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil, plus more if needed
* 2 shallots or 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* ½ cup diced sun-dried tomatoes
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste if you like
* ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
* 2 14.5-ounce cans whole peeled tomatoes
* Parmesan rind, optional
* Pinch of sugar, optional
* 12 ounces spaghetti
* ½ cup grated mozzarella
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Fried basil panko:**

* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 cup fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
* 1 cup panko
* ½ cup freshly grated parmesan
* Pinch of salt

**Fry the chicken:**

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF.
2. Heat 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the chicken into the pot, skin-side down, and fry without moving for 5 minutes until golden brown all over. Flip and cook for an additional 1–2 minutes. They need not be cooked through. Transfer to a plate.

**Start the sauce:**

1. To the pot of rendered chicken fat, add the diced shallots and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 3–5 minutes or until the shallots soften.
2. Add the minced garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Pour in the balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil.
4. Add the canned tomatoes and season all over with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat. Using a potato masher, gently mash the tomatoes. Add the parmesan rind and a pinch of sugar.

**Bake the chicken and sauce:**

1. Arrange the chicken on top of the sauce, skin-side up, and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. If using bone-in thighs, increase cooking time to 30–35 minutes. Once the internal temperature reaches 165ºF, remove the pot from the oven and turn on the broiler.

**Cook the spaghetti:**

1. While the chicken bakes, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Remove 1/3 cup of the pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain the pasta.

**Prepare the fried basil panko:**

1. In a small pot, heat 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the chopped basil leaves and stir constantly for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add the panko and stir to incorporate. Cook until the panko deepens in color and toasts. Turn off the heat. Let stand for 5–10 minutes.
3. Stir the grated parmesan into the panko. Add a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.

**Finish the chicken:**

1. Remove the parmesan rind from the sauce and discard it. Sprinkle a bit of mozzarella on top of each piece of chicken. Drizzle the mozzarella with a touch of extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Transfer the pot back to the oven under the broiler, and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven. Scatter a bit of the basil panko on top of the chicken and transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Don’t worry if some of the panko ends up in the sauce!

**Sauce the pasta:**

1. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce. Add the pasta cooking water, as needed, and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Spoon more fried basil panko on top and garnish with fresh basil. Enjoy!"

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Choux Pastry***

* ½ cup salted butter
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 4 extra large eggs

***Crema Pasticcera***

* 4 egg yolks
* 2 cups whole milk
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Lemon zest from 1 lemon

***Additional Toppings***

* Confectioners sugar
* Pitted cherries (either sour or maraschino)  


**INSTRUCTIONS**  
***Crema Pasticcera (Pastry Cream)***

1. In a pot over low heat, warm up the milk and vanilla until it starts to steam.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar, then add the cornstarch and whisk again until smooth.
3. Once the milk has warmed up, add about ½ cup of the milk to the egg mixture while constantly whisking. This will temper the eggs, so you don’t wind up with scrambled eggs.
4. Increase the heat on the stove to low-medium and add the egg mixture and lemon zest to the milk, whisking continuously. After a few minutes, the crema pasticcera will thicken up to a thick custard-like consistency.
5. Remove from heat, place in a bowl, and let cool on the counter for a few minutes.
6. Once the bowl is cool enough to handle, cover it with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic touches the cream. This will prevent it from forming a crust. Place in the refrigerator to cool further.

***Choux Pastry Dough***

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. In a pot over medium heat, bring butter, sugar, and water to a rolling boil.
3. Next, remove pot from heat, add all of the flour at once and vigorously stir until it forms a ball.
4. Add eggs one at a time then stirring until each egg is thoroughly incorporated. Stir until it reaches a consistency like a thick icing (not like a bread dough at all!).
5. Let cool a few minutes.

***Baking***

1. Prepare a baking sheet lined with either a silicone mat or parchment paper.
2. Place pastry dough in a piping bag with a star tip (or a ziploc bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
3. Pipe dough into circles measuring about 4 inches in diameter, working from the inside out, then make a second layer on top of the first, but leave a hole in the center of the second layer (this is where the pastry cream will be added later). Make sure to leave a few inches between each one, as they will puff up a bit while baking.
4. Bake for 30 minutes or until the dough turns a light golden brown. When lightly pressed with a finger, the zeppole will have slightly spongy feel, like a doughnut.
5. Let cool on the counter.

***Putting It All Together***

1. Once the zeppole have cooled, remove the crema pasticcera from the fridge and place in a piping bag with a star tip (or a ziploc bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
2. Pipe the cream into the center of each zeppole and continue around, making a circle of cream, then back to the middle for a tall center.
3. Lightly dust with powdered sugar and top with a cherry."

Get the full recipe, tips, & tricks at: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/peach-mango-turnovers/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/peach-mango-turnovers/)

  
**INGREDIENTS**  
17.3 oz box of Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets (2 sheets), thawed  
2 c peaches, diced (canned peaches in light syrup)  
2 c mangoes, diced  
5 Tbsp peach syrup (from the can)  
1/4 c granulated sugar  
5 tsp cornstarch  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1/2 tsp ground cloves  
1/2 tsp ground ginger  
2-3 mint leaves, finely minced (about 1 tsp)  
1 large egg (for egg wash)  
Coarse sugar

&#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**   


* Start by making the peach mango filling. Add all ingredients (except for egg and coarse sugar) to a pot, over low-medium heat.  

* Stir frequently, until the fruit softens just slightly and the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.  

* Then, remove from heat and let cool a bit while you prepare the dough and preheat oven to 400°F.  

* On a piece of parchment paper, unfold one sheet of puff pastry dough from the package.  
Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough just slightly, to measure about 12″ x 12″, then cut into four equal squares.  

* Prepare an egg wash by mixing together one large egg and a few drops of water, and beating with a fork.  

* Brush the egg wash along the edges of each of the squares (this will help seal the dough later on).  

* Next, using a tablespoon, drop about 3 Tbsp of filling into the center of each puff pastry square.  

* Fold over each square into a triangle shape and press down firmly along all of the edges, about 1/4″ all the way around. For a decorative element, you can then press all around the edges with the tines of a fork.  

* Using your hand, gently press down on the peach mango fruit filling, to make sure it has spread all throughout the inside of the turnover.  

* Brush egg wash all over the tops and edges of the turnovers, then sprinkle generously with coarse sugar.  

* Finally, lift the parchment paper (with the turnovers on it) to a baking sheet.  

* Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, rotating halfway through to ensure even browning, until the pastry has puffed up with a beautiful golden color.  

* Let cool slightly and serve warm. Enjoy for breakfast and dessert!"

If you make them in bulk, feel free to seal the leftover buns in a zip-lock bag, you can refrigerate them for 2-3 days or freeze them for weeks. Just defrost overnight and warm them up when you want a creamy bun for breakfast/brunch or dessert!

&#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/0_0p2gU-PFM)

&#x200B;

**Ingredients (10 buns):**

**Custard filling:**

\- 2 eggs

\- 20g cake flour

\- 10g cornstarch

\- 15g milk powder

\- 40g sugar

\- 15g condensed milk

\- 120g milk

\- 1g salt

\- 20g melted butter

**Dough:**

\- 250g all purpose flour

\- 130g warm water

\- 1 tsp (5ml) oil

\- 1/2 tsp (2g) yeast

\- 1 tsp (4g) sugar

&#x200B;

**Directions:**

**Custard filling:**

1. Mix the ingredients of the custard filling in a big bowl.
2. Cook the mixture using low to medium heat. Keep stirring until it forms a creamy texture. Put it aside for about 5 minutes to cool it off. The ingredients I used here can make 10 custard buns and the filling for one bun weighs about 28 grams.
3. Shape the filling into a ball shape using your palms. Cover them with a plastic wrapper and refrigerate them for later use.

**Dough:**

1. Dissolve the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Mix the flour, oil, and water together to form a dough. Knead the dough until it’s smooth.
2. Divide the dough into ten pieces evenly. Cover them with a plastic wrapper to prevent them from drying out.
3. Take out one piece and knead the dough for about 30 seconds to remove the air bubbles. Fold the edge of the dough into the center. Keep repeating this and you’ll get a smooth side. Flatten the dough using a rolling pin, push down and roll forward to the edge in a single motion, repeat this until you get a round shape, then thin the edge out.
4. Keep the smooth side down. Place the filling in the center of the dough, pinch the edge together and make sure to seal it completely.

**Steaming:**

1. Place all the buns in a steamer and let them proof for about 20 minutes in a warm environment ideally around 90^(o)F.
2. Place the steamer on top of the cold water, turn on the stove and use high heat to boil the water. Once the water starts boiling, you can hear the rolling boil sound and see the steam coming out. Set your timer for 12 minutes.
3. When the time is up, turn off the stove, but remember to leave the steamer closed for another 5 minutes. Enjoy!

&#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Because this recipe only requires the dough to rise once, there is no need to start the dough early.
2. The key to making the filling very creamy is to use a sifter twice. The first time is to sift through all the flours such as cake flour, cornstarch, and milk powder. The second time is to sift the mixture before heating it up.
3. The warm water and sugar will help to activate the yeast.
4. If you want to make this in bulk, a little bit of oil can help to maintain the softness of the dough for a few days.
5. Do not open the steamer immediately after the heat off, otherwise the buns will shrink due to the sudden change of the temperature."

*Time:* 40 mins

*Original Recipe:* [https://craftycookbook.com/marry-me-chicken-tortellini/](https://craftycookbook.com/marry-me-chicken-tortellini/)

Note, I didn't name this dish. ""Marry Me Chicken"" has been around for a while, it always features pan fried chicken breast served in a sun dried tomato cream sauce. This version serves it up over tortellini tossed in extra sauce.

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast
* 16-20 oz fresh or frozen cheese tortellini
* 2 cups half-and-half, or 1 cup cream + 1 cup whole milk
* 1 ½ tsp chicken better than bouillon, or chicken bouillon cubes
* ⅓ cup sun dried tomatoes, drained and chopped fine
* ½ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, or sub basil or parsley
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* ½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes (add more to make it spicy, or omit if very sensitive to spice)
* ½ tsp dried oregano
* olive oil
* garlic powder
* freshly cracked black pepper
* salt

**Instructions**

1. Fillet the chicken breast(s) and pound to a thin, even thickness. Season all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour flour onto a shallow plate and dredge the chicken in it, shaking off any excess.
2. Warm 2 tbsp olive oil over medium high heat, sear breasts for about 3 mins per side, until golden, then remove to a cutting board. Slice into the largest piece to ensure it’s cooked through, then tent with foil to keep warm. Do not wipe the pan clean. Turn off the heat to allow the pan to cool slightly.
3. Meanwhile, begin boiling a large pot of salted water. Cook the tortellini per package instructions while preparing the rest of the meal. Drain and cover to keep warm until needed. (Most cook times are short, so wait until the sauce is almost done)
4. In the pan you cooked the chicken, cook the garlic and red pepper flakes over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute), add more oil if needed.  Next, add the half-and-half and reduce heat to medium low. Add the bouillon and oregano, mix well and scrape any browned bits into the sauce. Once simmering, add the parmesan (reserving a little for garnish) and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is the consistency of thick cream, about 10 minutes.
5. After simmering, add the chopped sun dried tomatoes and mix well. Add the chicken back to the pan and spoon sauce over it until it’s coated. Warm it in the pan for 1-2 minutes, then remove to a cutting board and cut into bite sized pieces.
6. Toss the tortellini in the sauce, then plate into serving dishes. Top with the chicken, then garnish with the reserved parmesan and fresh thyme.

[Here's the full video recipe](https://youtu.be/Vy7JNArTRkE).

**Ingredients:**

* 25 grams of butter
* 240 ml of milk (room temperature)
* 35 grams of sugar + 3 tablespoons for coating
* 1/2 tsp of salt
* 1 egg (room temperature)
* 7 grams of dry yeast
* 380 grams of flour + 2 tablespoons for molding
* \~720 ml of frying oil

**Cooking method:**

1. Melt the butter and heat a little. Pour into a bowl. Add the room temperature milk and 35 grams of sugar and stir until dissolved. Then add the salt and egg and stir to combine. After that, add the yeast, stir and leave for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, add flour, mix with a spoon, and then knead a little with your hands until homogeneous. Cover with cling film and leave for 1.5 hours.
2. After 1.5 hours, when the dough has risen, remove the cling film, knead the dough into a ball and cover again for 40-60 minutes. The dough should double in size again.
3. After an hour, start rolling out the dough. Sprinkle the work surface with a little flour and transfer the dough to it. Divide the dough into 16 equal parts. Roll each piece into a ball and place all the balls under the cling film.
4. Next, roll each ball into a strip from the center to the edges, about 30 cm long. Then with one hand twist up the strip and with the other hand twist it down. Carefully lift the strip by joining the ends with your hands so that the strip curls. Pinch the ends of the dough. Repeat for all balls of dough.
5. Heat the frying oil over medium heat (about 720 ml for a 26 cm pan). You can check if the oil is ready with a wooden stick. Dip the stick into the oil and if the oil hisses and bubbles appear, the oil is hot enough.

**INGREDIENTS**

1 lb ground beef

2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

1 small yellow onion (1 cup)

2 cloves garlic, minced (1 Tbsp)

28-oz can whole San Marzano plum tomatoes

3 oz tomato paste

8 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed

4 oz Pecoroni Romano, grated

8 oz rigatoni

1/4 c pasta water

1/2 tsp kosher salt

1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper

2 Tbsp fresh Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped

**INSTRUCTIONS**

\-Preheat the oven to 375°F.

\-Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a skillet.

\-Add the ground beef. With a wooden spoon, break apart any clumps. Season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper.

\-After browning the ground beef for about 5 minutes over medium heat, add the chopped onions and mix. Cook for another 5 minutes, until the ground beef has nicely browned and the onions become translucent.

\-Add the minced garlic for just a minute.

\-Add the whole can of plum tomatoes (including any juices) and 3 oz of tomato paste. Bring to a simmer. Stir regularly and use tongs to help break apart the plum tomatoes.

\-In between stirring the sauce, finely grate 4 oz Pecorino Romano and cut 8 oz mozzarella into 1/2“ cubes.

\-Keep simmering and stirring the pot — smell, taste. Be careful with the salt. If it tastes just slightly under-salted, that’s perfect. The salty Pecorino Romano will close that gap when added before baking.

\-In the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to boil, add 8 oz rigatoni, and cook. Before draining the pasta, scoop out 1/4 c of the pasta water and add to the sauce.

\-Now we’re ready to put everything together and finish cooking in the oven. If you made the sauce in an oven-safe skillet, add the grated Pecorino Romano cheese and the cooked pasta. Mix well. Top with cubed mozzarella and in the oven it goes. Bake for 30 minutes. Otherwise, transfer the sauce to a baking dish, mix everything as above, and bake.

\-Once it’s ready to serve, remove from the oven and start heaping it on plates. Garnish with some roughly chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/u5qrtr,https://i.redd.it/h9d41j11a4u81.jpg,reddit,"Żurek is a traditional Polish soup and truly one of my favourites on the Easter holiday table. Prepared in many varieties that differ across Poland and every household. The flavour is complex and unique, thanks to the fermented Rye starter that works as the main ingredient. Once you try it you will love it just like I do :)

**How to prepare Żurek?**

First of all, to make Żurek you need to prepare the starter, it is simple and it doesn't require maintenance but it takes 5-7 days to ferment. You can also buy the premade version in European supermarkets but the flavour will not be as good as a homemade version.

This recipe makes 6 portions

**Ingredients for the starter:**

\* 500ml (0.52 quart) bottled or boiled water at room temperature (no chlorine)

\* 5tbsp rye flour (you can use wholemeal wheat flour as well)

\* 5 garlic cloves, peeled and slightly crushed

\* 4 bay leaves

\* 10 allspice berries

**Ingredients for the soup:**

\* 1,5 litre (1.58 quart) of vegetable bullion

\* 500ml (0.52 quart) of Żurek starter

\* 4 small pork sausages (you can also add smoked sausage)

\* 250g (8.8oz) uncut smoked bacon (boczek)

\* 1tsp marjoram

\* 3 tsp of double cream (soured cream works too)

\* Salt to taste

**To serve:**

\* Boiled diced potatoes

\* Hard-boiled eggs cut in half

\* Sourdough Bread

\* Fresh parsley or dill

\* Cracked black pepper

**Instructions for the starter:**

1. For the preparation of the starter, you need to use water without chlorine as it kills the microbes, simply boil the water first and let it cool down to room temperature.
2. Put all the starter ingredients into a clean jar and stir with a spoon to combine.
3. Cover the jar with a paper towel or a cloth and tie the top (this helps the starter to breathe).
4. Place the jar at room temperature away from the direct sunlight. After around 5-7 days your starter is ready to use. You can use it straight away or store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks (if you keep it in the fridge remove and discard spices from the starter, if you use it straight away you can add it as it is).

**Instructions for the bullion:**

1. To Prepare vegetable bullion combine 1L of water with a couple of diced carrots, 2 medium onions, a piece of celery and leek. Bring to the boil then reduce to simmer with a lid on the pot, set the timer for 1 hour.
2. Once the bullion is ready, separate the liquid from the vegetables (I keep carrots for the soup and discard everything else).

**Instructions for the soup:**

1. Dice bacon and pan-fry on high heat for 4-5 minutes to render the fat.
2. To the hot stock add fried bacon, cooked carrots, whole or sliced sausages, 1tsp of marjoram and bring to boil then simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Whisk Zurek starter and pour into the soup, simmer until soup thickens.
4. Take the soup off the heat and remove the sausages, slice and place back in the pot.
5. Put the cream in the bowl and add a ladle of the soup, mix it together and pour it back into the pot (this prevents the cream from curdling).
6. Serve Żurek with hard-boiled eggs and fresh sourdough bread.

Smacznego!

**Insight:**

\- You can add 1tbsp of grated horseradish to the soup, it works fantastic.

Before the travel restrictions took place, experiencing localized fast food in each area truly made up my travels, as each region has its own specialized dishes that cater to the demographic.

One of the most popular fast food items in Korea is the shrimp burger, also known as Ebi Katsu burger in Japan. Outside of Asia however, this kind of burger is extremely rare to find, which made it the perfect case for me to recreate the recipe at home!

This Korean Shrimp Burger brings together panko-breaded shrimp patties, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella cheese, and homemade sauce all wrapped in buttery brioche buns. Make this shrimp burger from scratch at home in just 20 minutes, without the trip to Asia. Enjoy everyone! x

400g pasta   (Short pasta such as penne, mezze penne, maccheroncini is preferable)    
1 small onion finely minced/grated     
250g canned crushed tomatoes    
200g diced bacon    
200g cooking cream/heavy cream    
Olive oil, salt, black pepper, Parmesan.   

Directions    

In a pan cook the bacon until crispy. Once the bacon is done, take it out but leave the bacon grease. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and then add the finely minced onion and sauté it gently. Once cooked add the canned crushed tomatoes and the bacon and let it cook covered for 15-20 min on low heat. Stir it occasionally and add a pinch of salt if necessary.    

Cook the pasta in boiling salted water. Drain the pasta al dente and put it directly in the sauce, add the cooking cream, some parmesan and pepper, stir it a couple of times and then serve it.    

Note:    
 
Cooking cream can be added/removed according to your taste. If you add more you need more salt since cooking cream tends to mitigate the saltiness of the bacon, if instead you decide to use less cream be mindful with salt. Also remember there is the Parmesan, so just make sure to taste it before serving.    
You can also add chili flakes."

• 1tbs of extra virgin olive oil (if you have EVOO with truffles it's even better!)   
• 2tbs of butter   
• 1 white onion   
• 1 carrot   
• 1 cup of celery   
• 450g / 1 pound of minced meat (I used 200g of ground pork to 250g of ground beef)  
• 1 cup / 240ml of milk   
• 1 cup / 240ml of dry white wine   
• 1 and ½ cup of canned tomato (basically one can)   
• Zest of sicilian lemon   
• Black pepper   
• Salt   
• Lots of water   
• Freshly grated cheese (parmesan or grana padano)

Preparation method:

1. Place the olive oil and the butter in a pan and wait for them to melt and heat up.

2. Add the chopped onion in a pot and turn on medium heat. Cook and stir the onion until it becomes translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Season them with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring the vegetables to coat them well.

3. Add the ground meat, a generous pinch of salt, and pepper. Break up the meat with a fork, stir well, and cook until the meat loses its raw red color.

4. Add the milk and let it simmer gently, stirring constantly, until it has completely bubbled away.Add the peeled lemon zests, and stir.

5. Add the wine, let it boil until evaporated completely (it will take about 20 to 30 minutes). Taste it and season it as needed.

6. Add the tomatoes and stir well to coat all the ingredients. Taste it and season as needed.

7. When the tomatoes start bubbling, reduce the heat as much as possible to let the sauce cook slowly, with only an intermittent bubble rising to the surface.

8. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more (6 hours for maximum flavor), stirring occasionally. Check it every 20-30 minutes. As the sauce cooks, you will likely notice it starting to dry out and the fat separating from the meat. To prevent sticking, add ½ cup of water whenever necessary.

9. In the end, however, there should be no water left, and the fat should separate from the sauce. Stir to mix the fat into the sauce, taste, and season it.

10. Add a ladle of the pasta cooking water if you want it to be more saucy. Add the cooked pasta into the bolognese pot and mix it so the sauce completely coats the pasta.

11. Serve with grated cheese and enjoy the best bolognese ever!"

I made it tonight and really enjoyed the end result. As with any marinade, the longer you let it sit, the better it is. I let it marinate for about 8 hours. 

There are likely better and simpler tzatziki recipes that don’t require fresh herbs that I will try in the future, but this was good. 

**Ingredients**

* 2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs

* Long wooden skewers

**The Yogurt Marinade**

* 2 cups greek yogurt

* ¼ cup lemon juice

* ¾ cup olive oil

* 1 tablespoon kosher salt

* 1 tablespoon garlic, minced

* 1 tablespoon coriander powder

* 1 tablespoon paprika

* 1 tablespoon ground cumin

* ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (full teaspoon for a spicier result)

* 1 teaspoon cinnamon

* 1 teaspoon black pepper

**Tzatziki Sauce**

* 1 large cucumber, shredded

* 2 cups greek yogurt

* 1 tablespoon garlic, minced

* ¼ cup lemon juice

* 2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped

* Salt and pepper to taste 

**For the Gyro**

* Pita bread
* Diced red onion
* Diced cucumber 
* Diced tomato 
* Feta cheese (optional, but I think it makes it) 


**Instructions**

* In a large bowl, combine marinade ingredients and stir well.

* On a cutting board, cut the chicken thighs into strips/cubes. You will be putting them on a skewer later, so keep that in mind when cutting

* In another large bowl or gallon plastic bag, combine chicken thighs and marinade, stirring well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour and up to one day

* Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

* Shred the cucumber, be sure to squeeze out any excess liquid.

* In a medium bowl, combine tzatziki ingredients and stir well. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
* Suspend your skewers over a baking dish like I did in the picture. 

* Bake for 40 minutes or, until internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). Let cool for 10 minutes. (The original recipe had a 2 HOUR cook time, mine took 40 minutes) 

* Put it on a pita and top with diced red onion, tomato, cucumber, and tzatziki sauce."

* 1/4 teaspoon ginger, grated

**Instructions**

Making pumpkin gnocchi dough

1. Boil water in a small pot. Once the water starts to boil add the russet potatoes and boil for 15-20 minutes. The time will vary due to the size of the potatoes. Use a fork to poke it and if the fork slides in easily it is cooked.
2. Take the russet potatoes out and let them cool down. Once it's slightly cooled down and can be handled begin to peel the skin off. Use a sharp knife and score the skin down to make it easier to peel.
3. Put the peeled cooked potato through a potato ricer to get a soft and consistent texture.
4. Lay out the paper towel and spread the pumpkin puree on top and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Complete this step 2-3 times until the pumpkin puree is dry.
5. Mix the flour, dried pumpkin puree, potatoes and salt in a bowl. The dough should be a soft texture. Add minimal flour if the dough is too wet. Avoid adding too much flour this will make the gnocchi tough in texture once cooked.
6. Dust a flat surface with flour and pour the dough and knead for about 5 minutes. Cut the dough into 6 pieces. Roll into a 1-inch rope and cut into 1-inch wide pieces.

Forming the pumpkin shape gnocchi

1. Roll the cut pieces of dough into a ball with both of your hands in a circular motion. Press the ball down from the top to give it a flattened pumpkin shape. The best tool to create the pumpkin grooves is with a toothpick or string. Press down from the top and press along the sides. I do this 4 times on the top to create the groves all around the pumpkin.
2. Freeze for 30 minutes to keep the shape before cooking.

Cooking

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the pumpkin gnocchi for 1-2 minutes or until the pumpkin gnocchi floats to the top.
2. In a medium saucepan melt the butter and add the garlic and ginger on medium heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes until you can smell the garlic and singer infuse into the butter. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil. Stir for 30 seconds and add the cook pumpkin gnocchi and mix well. Place the cloves on top of each pumpkin gnocchi to make them look more realistic.
3. Serve immediately. Remember to remove the cloves as they aren’t edible.

**Tips**

Freeze the pumpkin-shaped gnocchi in the freezer for 30 minutes to hold the shape better before cooking."

Feel free to use store bought red bean paste or edible cookie dough for fillings. Here is a step-by-step [**Video Instruction**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1v_o1ycrKs&t=18s) for following along, see [blogpost](http://www.workdaygourmet.net/2019/10/3-ingredient-pumpkin-mochi-halloween.html) for recipe details.  

**Ingredients:**

*mochi dough*:  
 1/2 lb butternut squash (or kabocha/acorn)  
 1 cup mochiko, aka sticky rice flour

2\~4 tbsp maple syrup \* 

*black sesame filling:*  
 1/4 cup black sesame  
 1/4 cup walnut pieces  
 2\~3 tbsp brown sugar - or to taste  
 2 tbsp coconut oil \*\*

\* you can use any sweetener, honey, brown sugar, agave, zero calorie sweetners - adjust based on sweetness of your squash. you want your puree to be sweet enough to offset the addition of rice flour  
 \*\* any fat that's solid at room temperature will do. I used refined coconut oil, which is flavor neutral. Margarine or Earth balance would work the same. Butter and virgin coconut oil will work texture-wise, just know that they'll affect the flavor a little.  
 

**Instruction:**

Start with the black sesame filling. Ground walnut & black sesame in a food processor until you get a fine powder. mix in brown sugar and coconut oil. Mix until evenly combined. Use a cookie dough scoop to scoop out small balls of fillings. Chill the fillings until ready to use. This will harden the filling a little and make them easier to wrap. 

While filling is chilling, make the mochi dough. Cut squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Microwave for \~5 minutes or until softened. Scoop out the soft flesh and mash it with a wooden spoon. Add maple syrup, adjust based on sweetness of your squash. Add mochiko. Mix until even and roll the dough out. Cut into small portions & roll into small balls.

Wrap each individual filling in each portion of mochi dough. Carve some wedges around the mochi with a bamboo skewer so they look like little pumpkins. Steam for 10\~15 minutes, or until mochi is cooked through. It should look a little translucent, with a deep orange color.

Fresh steamed mochi can be very sticky. Careful not to break them when taking them out of the steamer. You can brush them with a little vegetable oil first to prevent sticking."

# Japanese Fried Chicken (Karaage)
[Here's a video for those of who would like to see how it all comes together!](https://youtu.be/sE1PJ8ivXUw)
# Ingredients
- Skinless boneless chicken thigh, 1 lb (about two large thighs)
- All-purpose flour 2 heaping tbsp
- 1 egg
- Potato starch or corn starch for battering
- Oil for frying
- Marinade
- Minced garlic 5 cloves
- Minced ginger ½ inch piece
- Soy sauce 3 tbsp
- Cooking sake 2 tbsp
- GARNISH
- Japanese shishito (substitute with seeded jalapenos)
- Japanese Kewpie Mayo
- Japanese 7 spice powder Shichimi

[Full written recipe with ingredients and instructions here.](https://straightupeats.com/crunchy-japanese-chicken-recipe/)

# Instructions
1. Slice the chicken thigh into 7-8 large chunks (refer to the video for a visual aid) and add into a large mixing bowl.
2. Add the **MARINADE** ingredients to the chicken and mix well. Allow the meat to marinade for 10 minutes.
3. Pour out the excess marinade liquid into a separate bowl and set aside.
4. Beat 1 egg and add it to the meat and mix to combine.
5. Add the flour and mix well until no dry flour is visible.
6. Pour the potato starch into a shallow tray and pour in the reserved marinade liquid. Mix the liquid into the starch and press down on any large lumps to create small nuggets. These will add extra crunch to the batter.
7. Batter the chicken pieces in the potato starch one by one (refer to the video for a visual aid). Then lay them onto a sheet, making sure that they are not touching each other. Allow them to sit in the open for five minutes for the outside to dry out. This ensures a crunchier crust on the chicken.
8. Add enough oil for frying to a large pot and heat it to 180 celcius (about 350 F). I highly recommend the use of a kitchen thermometer, as it will ensure that your oil is at the perfect temperature.
9. TRIPLE FRY TECHNIQUE:
10. Add the chicken to the oil, piece by piece. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Allow the pieces to sit in the oil, undisturbed for about 15 seconds. Then, gently move them around, making sure that they don’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Allow them to continue frying for another 45 seconds (1 minute in total), gently agitating them in the oil.
11. Remove the pieces from the oil onto a draining pan and allow them to rest for 30 seconds.
12. Add the partially cooked chicken back into the oil and fry them for 1 minute.
13. Remove the pieces from the oil again for another 30 seconds.
14. Add the partially cooked chicken back into the oil for one final minute. Remove from the oil and drain well. Continue cooking the rest of the chicken using this triple fry technique.
15. *Optional* Add the shishito peppers (or jalapenos) to the oil and fry until the skin begins to blister, about 30 seconds - 1 minute. Be careful of popping oil. Remove from oil and allow to drain.
16. Pile the chicken onto a plate. Garnish with peppers and slices of lemon. Add a dollop of mayonnaise and sprinkle Japanese 7-spice powder onto the mayonnaise. Serve immediately."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/l630lj,https://i.redd.it/a0alp17y6vd61.jpg,reddit,"A long time ago in Krakow, there used to be that place where you could buy Gyros Kebab served in the puffed pitta bread. It is one of those that you start shovelling with your fork and halfway through you grab it with your hands.

Delicious grilled chicken in the very characteristic Greek spice blend, crunchy salad with gherkins, loads of garlic sauce. I tried to recreate that dish and without a shadow of a doubt, I succeeded.

The spice blend you can prepare in advance and store it in the jar. These ingredients should give you enough to make this recipe twice.

**Ingredients for Gyros spice blend:**

* 1tsp mild chilli powder
* 1tsp ground coriander
* 1/2tsp turmeric
* 3tsp oregano
* 1tsp marjoram
* 3tsp paprika
* 1tsp garlic powder
* 1tsp onion powder
* 0,5tsp ground fenugreek
* 1tsp ground mustard seeds
* 1tsp sugar
* 2tsp salt

This recipe makes 4 big portions

**Ingredients for the chicken:**

* 3 big chicken breasts sliced
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* half of the gyros spice blend
* 2 skewers

**Ingredients for the salad and sauce:**

* 1 medium onion sliced
* 2 medium tomatoes diced (sweeter than better)
* half of the small Chinese leaf thinly sliced
* 200g (7oz) of sweet gherkins diced
* 150g (5.3oz) sweetcorn
* 150g (5.3oz) thick yoghurt
* 2tsp mayo
* 1/2tsp oregano
* 1/2tsp black pepper
* 3 garlic cloves minced

**Ingredients for Pitta bread:**

* 350g (12.3oz) strong flour (contains more gluten, this helps to hold shape upon inflation)
* 1tsp baking powder
* 1tsp sugar
* 1tsp salt
* 100ml (0.1quart) milk (you can use water instead)
* 130g (4.6oz) yoghurt
* 50g (1.9oz) melted butter

**Instructions for chicken and salad:**

**1.** Mix the **chicken** with the **olive oil** and **spice blend**, skewer and leave it for minimum **30 minutes** or marinate **overnight**.

**2.** For the sauce mix **yoghurt** with minced **garlic**, **mayonnaise**, **oregano** and **black pepper**.

**3.** Grill the chicken skewers in the oven  250C (482F) for around **10 minutes** then turn upside down and grill for another **10 minutes** (place skewers in a baking dish). When ready take of the skewer and cover with tin foil to keep warm (thighs may need a little longer).

**4.** To serve **cut pitta in half** and stuff with **salad**, **chicken** and **sauce** (pour some of the chicken juice inside for extra flavour).

**Instructions for pitta:**

**1.** For the pitta bread mix all the **dry ingredients** together then **add all the wet**. Mix then knead for around **5 minutes**, until a smooth dough ball is formed. Rest for **30 minutes** covered with bowl or clingfilm.

**2.** Heat the oven to **250C (482F)** for at least **15 minutes** (for the pitta bread you will need to heat bakers stone, cast iron pan or a tray).

**3.** Divide the pitta dough into **four** and roll each one to a **20cm circle** about **2mm thick** (8-inch circle, about 0.08inch thick).

**4.** Place the dough on to the heated baking stone or cast iron pan. Applying heat from the bottom and the top will create puffed pitta, watch it closely not to burn it, this takes around **3,5 minutes**. (Do one at the time, and you may need to heat up your baking surface again before doing another one).

📷📷

**Insight:**

* I also like gyros chicken just with gherkin salad.
* If your pitta is not puffed, increase temperature or try to heat the oven for a longer time or roll pittas slightly thicker. You may also need to reheat the stone/cast iron between each pitta.

This mushroom corn chowder is unbelievably easy to prepare and is so rich and creamy. It's the perfect way to bid farewell to summer.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 55 minutes

Servings: 6

Calories: 359kcal

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Small skillet

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil
* 2 shallots peeled and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms sliced, diced, or torn depending on the variety
* 1/3 cup flour
* 5 –6 cups water or stock
* 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper optional
* 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
* 5 Yukon gold potatoes peeled and diced into 1” cubes
* 5 ears of corn husked and corn cut from the cob
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* Salt to taste

## Mushroom topping:

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 ounces mushrooms sliced, diced, or torn depending on variety
* 4 ounces biquinho peppers or diced bell peppers cherry tomatoes, or chopped roasted red bell peppers

## Instructions

## Cook the aromatics:

* Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced shallot and cook for 5 minutes.

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Melt the butter into the shallot and add the mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms turn golden brown. Continue cooking until they release their liquid and the liquid evaporates. You want to ensure that your mushrooms develop a golden crust! Season with salt.

## Prepare the roux:

* Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir to coat. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the flour begins to turn a light golden color.
* Slowly whisk in one cup of liquid and whisk until smooth. Continue adding the liquid, one cup at a time, whisking after each addition until 5 cups of the liquid have been incorporated. If the broth seems too thick, add the remaining 1 cup of liquid–season with salt, white pepper, crushed red pepper, and Aleppo pepper (if using). Bring to a boil.

## Simmer the chowder:

* Add the corn and potatoes to the boiling chowder and immediately reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes–taste and season to your preferences. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Note: If you are using milk, half and half, or sour cream, be sure to temper them before adding to the chowder. Scoop out a bowl of the hot broth and stir the cold milk or sour cream into it and then add it back to the chowder. If using heavy cream, you do not need to temper it.

## Prepare the garnish:

* After you've added the heavy cream to the chowder, prepare the garnish. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a small skillet. Once hot, melt the butter and add the mushrooms and peppers. Cook without moving for 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes. Turn off the heat and season with salt.

## To serve:

* Ladle the chowder into bowls and spoon the hot mushrooms and peppers on top. Sprinkle with more red pepper flakes on top if desired. Enjoy!

* 1/3 cup Oyster Sauce
* 1 tbsp Chinese Rice Wine
* 1/2 tsp Chinese Five Spice Powder
* 1 tbsp Lemongrass finely chopped
* 1 kg Skin on Chicken Thighs
* 1 tbsp Butter
* 2 tbsp Honey  
**Instructions**

1. In a medium bowl, mix together the chili, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, Chinese rice wine, Chinese Five Spice, and lemongrass.
2. Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade then store in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
3. Preheat oven to 400 F.
4. Arrange the marinated chicken thighs on a roasting pan then bake in the middle rack of the oven for 15-25 minutes.
5. After 25 minutes, take out the chicken and pour any juices into a small saucepan. Flip the chicken then return to the oven for another 15 minutes.
6. Add the butter to the saucepan with the honey. Reduce for a few minutes until it has been reduced by a third and is a thicker sauce.
7. Take the chicken back out and pour the honey sauce evenly over the chicken, then cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until the juices run clear when pierced at the thickest point.
8. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
9. Serve hot with steamed rice."

It's called ""Kue Mangkok"" which directly translates too ""Cupcake"" or ""Bowl Cake"". This is a fun recipe in which you can mix and match colours and flavours by just changing the essence and food colouring. You can use pandan, vanilla, even chocolate. I think It's a very fun snack to make and it's not difficult at all, requires no special ingredients either (maybe rice flour). Plus it also looks like a flower, which is why I named it Flower Cupcake :)

​Ingredients:

Wet Ingredients:

- Sugar 150 gms

- Water 200 ml

- Coconut Milk 65 ml

Dry Ingredients:

- All Purpose Flour 65 gms

- Rice FLour 125 gms

- Yeast 1/2 tsp

Others:

- Red Food Colour

- Essence (Vanilla or Rose)

- Baking Powder 1 tsp

Method:

- Mix wet ingredients and heat until sugar is dissolved, keep aside until not hot and just warm

- Mix dry ingredients and add the now warm wet ingredients into the mix

- Strain and add essence of your choice + food colouring

- Rest for 30 minutes, no more, no less

- Add Baking Powder and mix well

- Pour into small plastic/silicon ramekins (about 1/4 cup size)

- Steam for exactly 15 minutes

- Take it out and let it cool down until you can handle it (10 minutes max)

- Gently pry it out of the ramekin

- Enjoy

Notes:
  

  
\- Please follow the recipe to a T. The dough does not need a long time to proof and the baking powder helps a lot with that. Over proofing may lead to the batter to not rise properly
  

  
\- You should use silicon/plastic molds for this. I have tried with metal ones, and they do work in a pinch, but you might wanna let it cool completely before taking it out of the ramekin

* 300g of egg whites (135 calories)
* 60g of all-purpose flour (220 calories)
* 2g of baking powder (4 cal)
* 112g of plain 0% fat greek yogurt (64 calories)
* Vanilla drops (optional)
* Nutmeg and Cinnamon (optional)
* Sweetner of your choice (optional)

**Directions**

1. In a large bowl, whisk 300g of egg whites until fluffy and peaks form when you remove the whisk. I recommend using an electric hand mixer. 

2. Add to the bowl 60g of all-purpose flour, 2g of baking powder, and 112g of plain greek yogurt. You can add sweetener, too. You can add cinnamon and Nutmeg . Do mind that these add calories.

3. Whisk again until everything is well mixed.
4. In a non-stick pan at medium heat, pour 1/3 of a cup (78ml) of batter. After 1 min, turn the pancake for another min. I get ten 5-inch pancakes for the whole bowl.


Enjoy! 

* I like to add 140g of strawberries and a healthy amount of sugar-free syrup.
* I like to add, instead of strawberries, 80g of thinly sliced turkey breast for more protein.
* You can easily use half of the ingredients to get 5 pancakes and replace it with more toppings of your choice.
This recipe kept me sane and feeling full during my weight loss journey. It comes at about 423 calories and 41g of protein. 473 calories with the strawberries."

10. Cut the cake in half and spread a thing layer of whipped cream evenly (about 1/4 of the total cream) over one half. Place the strawberry slices on top, pressing them down into the cream a little. Spread more cream over the top so that strawberries are completely covered.
11. Gently place the other half of cake on top. Cover with the remaining whipped cream.
12. Chill the cake for about an hour to help set the cream and create a cleaner cross section. Trim off the edges with a sharp knife and decorate the top with halved strawberries."

[Original Source](https://youtu.be/mxiD8zWEozE)

**Ingredients:**

* 4 TBSP Butter (\~52 g)
* 6 TBSP Flour (\~52 g)
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 1 medium carrot, peeled, diced
* 2 celery stalks, diced
* 1 parsnip, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 32 oz chicken stock (\~960 ml)
* 1/8 cup white wine (\~30 ml)
* 1 sprig of thyme (rosemary or other aromatic herbs work well too)
* 6 to 8 oz cubed Leftover roasted chicken (170 g - 230 g) - Sear a chicken breast if you do not have chicken.
* 1 serving cooked egg noodles or pastina (56 g)
* Coarse Kosher Salt to Taste - **Very important, see step 6**
* Fresh Ground Pepper to Taste

***Method:***

1. Prepare your mise en place. Cut up the vegetables and chicken, gather all of the other ingredients.
2. Create the roux, by heating the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Let the butter bubble a little bit to cook off some of the water (30 seconds) then add the flour and stir for a couple of minutes until it smells like a pie crust.
3. Add in the diced onions, carrot, celery, parsnip and garlic with a 4 finger pinch of salt. Stir and cook for about 10 minutes until the vegetables are softened.
4. Add the chicken stock and white wine and stir to combine. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil while stirring. Add in the sprig of thyme, reduce the heat to low and **let simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.** This will cook out the starchy grainy texture of the roux. If after thirty minutes the soup still feels grainy, continue cooking for another 5-10 minutes while stirring lightly.
5. Meanwhile, boil a pot of salted water (1 TBSP for 1/2 gallon of water). Cook and drain your egg noodles or pastina pasta.
6. Once the soup is seasoned, remove the sprig of thyme and stir in the cooked noodles and leftover roasted chicken.
7. **TASTE & SEASON THE SOUP**. Add coarse kosher salt and pepper gradually, stir it, taste it, repeat. We have not added much salt to this point so it will likely need more than you think.
8. To serve, ladle into a warmed soup bowl and garnish with freshly chopped parsley."

It may be the hottest part of summer, but it's always a good time for cheese tortellini with sausage ragu. This is the ultimate comfort food recipe.

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 2 hours

Total Time: 2 hours 20 minutes

Servings: 6 Calories: 814kcal

Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot
* Colander

IngredientsSausage Ragu:

* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil plus more, if needed
* 3 carrots peeled and finely minced
* 3 ribs celery trimmed and finely minced (mince the leaves, too, if there are any)
* 1 yellow onion peeled and finely minced
* 12 ounces mushrooms trimmed and finely minced
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 pound hot Italian sausage loose (or remove casings from sausage links)
* 1/2 cup red wine or beef stock
* 28 ounces canned crushed tomatoes
* Pinch of sugar if needed
* 1-2 cups beef stock more or less, as necessary
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

For Serving:

* 16 ounces store-bought tortellini
* Freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Fresh cracked black pepper

InstructionsCook the Aromatics:

* Start the sausage ragu by sautéing the aromatics. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the carrots, onion, and celery (diced ribs and leaves) and cook for 8-10 minutes until softened and turning golden brown on the edges. Season with salt and pepper.
* Add the finely minced mushrooms to the pot and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms release their liquid and the liquid evaporates. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.
* Remove the cooked aromatics and mushrooms from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Set aside.

Cook the Meat:

* If the pot is too dry, add a touch more oil over medium heat. Add the sausage and beef and cook for 10-15 minutes, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until it is completely cooked through and begins to develop a golden-brown crust on the pieces. Remove from the pan and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain off the excess fat. Drain off all but a few teaspoons of fat in the pot, but don't remove the fond stuck to the bottom.

Finish the Ragu:

* Return the cooked meat and vegetables to the pot over high heat. Once they begin to sizzle and brown around the edges (about 1-2 minutes), deglaze the pot with red wine and scrape up all the browned bits stuck to the bottom. Bring to a boil for 3-4 minutes until the wine reduces slightly.
* Add the crushed tomatoes and 1-2 cups of beef stock. Add a pinch of sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 1-2 hours until the ragu is thickened. Stir the ragu occasionally and add more beef stock, if necessary, to loosen up the ragu. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper.

Cook the Tortellini:

* About 20 minutes before the ragu is done, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the tortellini according to package instructions. I recommend cooking about 1-2 minutes under the instructions since you'll toss the tortellini with the ragu for a minute or so after they've cooked.
* Drain the tortellini and set aside.
* Toss the cooked tortellini with the ragu over low heat for 1-2 minutes. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the cooked tortellini with ragu between plates and garnish with parmesan cheese and fresh cracked black pepper. Enjoy!

Notes

\*Note: Only toss the tortellini with as much ragu as you need. Store the ragu and tortellini separately in the fridge and combine when you plan to reheat it.

This is for a 5-ingredient vegan project I'm working on (not including oil, water, salt, and pepper) You can add more ingredients to the sauce as you like. My sun-dried tomatoes are preserved with garlic, but you can add minced garlic to the sauce. Or you can sauté a diced onion or shallot prior to adding the sun-dried tomatoes to the pot.

If you're not vegan, a splash of cream to finish the sauce would be delicious too. And if you want a bit of protein, some diced grilled chicken would be great in this.

Spinach would also be a great addition. Add it to the sauce before stirring in the pasta.

**INGREDIENTS:**

* 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, diced
* 1 tablespoon of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes
* 4 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob
* 1 cup water or vegetable stock
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 ounce fresh basil, thinly sliced, a few leaves left whole and reserved for garnish
* 16 ounces dry rigatoni or orecchiette
* Extra virgin olive oil for garnish
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

**METHOD:**

**Cook the tomatoes:**

* Add 1 tablespoon of oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes to a wide pot. Turn the heat to medium.
* Once hot, add the diced sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until softened. Add the corn and cook an additional 3–5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.

**Simmer the sauce:**

* Pour in the water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the halved cherry tomatoes and reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes. The liquid should reduce by half. Taste and season once more to your preferences.
* Finish the sauce by adding the sliced basil. Toss to combine.

**Cook the pasta:**

* As the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the rigatoni until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.
* Add the pasta cooking water to the sauce and bring it to a boil. Add the pasta and reduce heat to low. Toss to coat for 1–2 minutes until glossy. Turn off the heat and season one final time to your preferences.

**To serve:**

* Divide the cooked pasta between bowls. Garnish with a few basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Enjoy!"

I love the variety of spices used in that cuisine, not to mention their health benefits.  
  
From all the South Asian dishes Chicken Tandoori is definitely one of my favourites, especially when served on fragrant rice like Biryani. Enjoy cooking!  
  
The secret of the best Chicken Tandoori is the meat quality and marinating time.  
  
The longer marinating period the better. It gives the meat enough time to absorb all those beautiful flavours!  
  
Remember to always pick the meat from suppliers that do respect animal welfare, if you cannot afford it try to eat less meat but better sourced.  
  
Making cuts in the meat helps the marinade to penetrate deeper, thus giving a better result.

When cooking chicken legs the core temperature should reach 80C (176F) significantly higher than a breast meat 72C (162F)  
  
Remember to rest the meat after cooking, this helps the juices to redistribute in each piece.  
  
Soaking rice helps it to absorb moisture inside each grain. This helps to cook quicker and better.

You need to do some prepping at the beginning, but then you can just pop it in the oven and forget about it.

Check the pictures and steps at: https://www.instagram.com/p/CEOhDhgpudQ/?igshid=1smuax8hx6gix

**Ingredients**

- ~1.5 kg of Oxtail 
- Veg: 4-5 carrots, 2 onions, 2 leeks, garlic
- Herbs: rosemary, thyme, whatever you fancy
- 1-2 glasses of red wine or a pint of Guinness
- Stock (whichever you prefer / have) or water
- 1-2 tablespoon plain flour
- Olive oil, salt and pepper

**Steps**

1. Either sear the oxtail pieces in a pan with some oil, or pop them under the oven grill. The goal is to sear the meat and get it brown (not cooked through). 

2. In the meantime, cook the veg in olive oil in a Dutch oven (or something that can go in the oven) until golden brown. Add the herbs.

3. Add 1-2 tablespoons of flour and lightly cook (this will thicken the sauce later on). Deglaze the bottom of the pan with wine or the pint of Guinness. 

4. Add the oxtail pieces to the pan /Dutch oven and pour the stock until it covers most of the meat. Bring everything to a boil, cover with the lid and pot it in the oven at low temperature (~150°C, no fan) for at least 3-4 hours. 

5. Check it every now and then. If too much liquid evaporated, add some extra stock/water. If it's still too liquidy, take the lid off to enhance evaporation. 

6. Once the meat is soft and fall-off-the-bone tender the dish is ready. You can blend the sauce and cook it down until thick and glossy."

This recipe makes enough dough for 2 loaves of pepperoni bread (you’ll have to double the fillings though). So, my recommendation is to either double the “fillings” or save the other half of the dough to make a homemade pizza!

For full recipe, tips, tricks, & other filling ideas, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/pepperoni-roll-pepperoni-bread/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/pepperoni-roll-pepperoni-bread/)

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Pizza Dough (makes 2)

* 1-1/4 c warm water
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 2 tsp instant yeast
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 3-1/2 c flour
* 1-1/4 tsp salt

#### Fillings (makes 1)

* 5 oz pepperoni, sliced thin
* 1 lb mozzarella cheese, grated or cut into thin strips
* 1/4 c Parmesan cheese, grated
* 1 large egg, beaten
* 2 Tbsp butter, melted
* Your favorite Italian spices and herbs (garlic powder, oregano, basil, etc)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* In a stand mixer bowl, using a spoon, stir together warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for five minutes or until it becomes frothy. Then, add olive oil and stir again.
* In a separate bowl, mix together flour and salt. 
* Using the dough hook attachment, turn your stand mixer on to a low-medium speed (about 3 or 4). Slowly add the flour mixture while the dough hook is turning. Mix until dough pulls away from sides of the bowl, about two minutes.
* Form dough into a ball. Grease a large bowl with olive oil, place the dough ball in the bowl, and turn it over and over so that all sides of the dough are oiled. Cover with a towel and place in a warm spot for about one hour, until dough has doubled in size.
* Preheat oven to 375°. 
* Cut dough in half. Wrap half tightly in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for up to two days.
* Roll out the other half of the dough until it measures approx 16″ x 12″, give or take.
* Brush the surface of the rolled out dough with beaten egg. 
* Next, cover the surface of the dough with pepperoni, then mozzarella, then Parmesan.
* Starting on a long side, roll up the dough (fairly tightly), and pinch the ends under.
* Place your formed pepperoni bread on a baking sheet, seam-side down.
* Mix Italian herbs and spices (like garlic powder, oregano, basil, etc) into melted butter and brush over the top of the pepperoni bread.
* Bake for 35-40 minutes or until dough is lightly browned. Slice and serve hot, warm, room temperature, or right from the fridge. If you want to take it another step, heat up some spaghetti sauce or pizza sauce for dipping!
* Store in a resealable plastic bag on the countertop for several days, in the fridge for up to five days, or in the freezer for up to a month. To reheat, microwave each slice for about 30 seconds. Enjoy!"

INGREDIENTS
For the ""ladyfingers sponge""

3 eggs
60 gr granulated sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
70 gr all purpose flour
2 shots of espresso, (for dipping later)
0.3dl wine liquor (prosecco), (for dipping later)

For the tart crust

200 gr all purpose flour
150 gr room temperature butter
20 gr powdered sugar
1 egg yolk
1/2 tsp salt
1 shot espresso

For the tiramisu cream:

5 eggs
100 gr granulated sugar
500 gr mascarpone cheese
0.7 dcl wine liquor (prosecco)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt

To garnish

cocoa


..........

METHOD
For the tart crust:

1)
Place your softened butter into a mixing bowl, add sifted sugar and mix well with a spatula, until creamy.

2)
Now add your yolk and continue mixing.

3)
Now add your espresso and mix to incorporate. (Once you mix in your espresso the buttery mix will seem to have separated, but just give it a good beating for a minute and it will come back together.)

4)
once all your wet ingredients are beautifully blended, add your sifted flour and salt.

5)
Work the dough with your hands as least as possible until roughly formed a dough (Do not kneed!)

6)
Press your dough down with your hands into a disc, cover with cling film and refrigerate for an hour.

For the ""ladyfingers sponge""

1)
While our dough is resting, we will prepare this simple sponge.

pre heat the oven to 170*C and separate yolks and whites. In a mixing bowl place your egg yolks along with 30gr sugar and beat well with a mixer until very thick, light yellow and creamy. (this will take somewhere between 5-10 minutes) best way to check is to dip your finger into the cream. If you don’t feel any sugar you’re good to go.

2)
Now add vanilla extract and mix well shortly until incorporated.

3)
In a separate bowl, mix egg whites, along with a small pinch of salt on medium speed until you get soft peaks. (2-3 minutes). Once soft peaks are present, turn the speed to high adding the rest of you sugar (30gr) gradually. Mix until you get sharp spikes and a glossy firm texture. (Or flip the bowl over your head and check if it falls….on your head.)

4)
Now sift the flour over the egg yolks mixture then add salt and 1/3 of your egg whites meringue.

5)
Fold in your flour and meringue with a spatula gently going all the way from the bottom to the top as flour tends to fall down.

6)
Once incorporated, add the rest of your meringue and keep gently folding.

7)
Once all the ingredients are well combined, transfer to a baking tray aligned with parchment paper. (I drizzled a bit of oil under the parchment paper to help it stick.)

8)
Now using a offset spatula, distribute the mixture evenly around the surface making sure it’s not more than 0.5cm thick.

9)
Place inside your preheated oven on 170*C and bake for about 15 minutes or until beautifully golden brown.

10)
Once done, turn the oven off and leave it inside for another half an hour or so. If the oven seems too hot, or if the dough has already got a rather darker color, open the oven door slightly to let some of the heat out.

11)
Once done, while still warm cut out the sponge to your desired shape to fit your tart mold.

Back to tart crust:

1)
Place your chilled tart dough in between two sheets of parchment paper and flour lightly.

2)
Gently roll out the dough. Apply no greater pressure than the rolling pin itself. Applying pressure while rolling tart crust will cause it to break, so just be patient.

3)
So basically the easiest way to make a round shape is to pass the rolling pin back and forth until it doubles in length, then rotate the dough 45* and repeat this step.

4)
Roll the dough until very thin (about 5 mm), and feel free to lightly dust as needed while rolling. Also make sure the diameter of the dough is about 6 cm wider than the diameter of the mold. (the recipe works for up to 28 cm molds)

5)
Now align your baking mold with parchment paper and grease the edges with butter.

6)
Tuck in the edges of the mold, but very gently, as pressing hard would make the dough think around the edges and collapse the tart.

7)
Place the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes (or even better into a freezer) to let the dough set and pre heat the oven to 175*C.

8)
Take out of the fridge and poke the dough with a fork. This is crucial so the dough doesn’t bubble up from escaping steam while baking.

9)
Now to blind bake the tart pastry, cover the whole dough with parchment paper, it’s important to cover the edges as well, as they would burn off very quickly.

10)
Now fill the dish with baking beans, rice, beans, lentils or what ever you have in your pantry.

11)
Place inside your pre heated oven on 175*C for 20 minutes. Once done let cool off 15-20 minutes with the beans still in place, then remove beans and let cool completely.

To make the tiramisu cream.

1)
Separate egg yolks from egg whites. Place your yolks in a heatproof bowl, along with sugar, and wine liquor.

2)
Place the bowl over bain-marie on medium heat and whisk constantly until thick and creamy. (it will take in between 5-10 minutes.)

3)
Once beautifully creamy and bright yellow, remove from the heat and add mascarpone (preferably room temp.) to your egg mixture, along with vanilla and a small pinch of salt.

4)
Beat well with a whisk until incorporated. At first you’re going to think, no, this will never come together I need a mixer, and 30 seconds later it will come together.

5)
If your mascarpone cheese wasn’t room temp like mine, you’ll need to pass the cream through a fine sieve to remove lumps.

6)
Now beat your egg whites along with a small pinch of salt until you get sharp peaks and a glossy thick texture. (You don’t really need the salt when making meringue, salt or acid just helps it stay together.)

7)
Once your meringue is beautifully thick and glossy, add half of it to your mascarpone cream and fold in slowly and carefully.

8)
Once all is incorporated, add the second half and fold again.

To build your tart:

1)
Take your crust, and fill the bottom with tiramisu cream and spread out evenly using a silicone or offset spatula.

2)
Now mix together two shots of espresso and wine liquor. Very quickly dip the ladyfinger sponge into the mixture on both sides and place over the cream. (Less is definitely more when soaking ladyfingers in coffee! leaving them any longer than two seconds will make them fall apart and make your tiramisu watery as they will absorb too much liquid.)

3)
Now fill the tart with cream to the top and even it out with an offset spatula.

4)
decorate per wish with more cream and sift over fresh cocoa."

Homemade gnocchi is not as daunting to make as it may seem, and this homemade sweet potato gnocchi with creamy sage sauce is a delicious dinner recipe!

I will say, homemade gnocchi is a perfect option for a romantic weekend dinner, but if you feel like being adventurous, you can absolutely make these pillowy little sweet potato gnocchi on a weeknight too!

This recipe will make quite a bit of gnocchi, so I would recommend freezing half the gnocchi before boiling and saucing the remaining half! If you want to sauce all the gnocchi, be sure to make double the amount of sauce in this recipe.

# Ingredients

**Sweet Potato Gnocchi:**

3 sweet potatoes

16 ounces whole milk ricotta cheese, strained\*

1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

3 teaspoons salt

2 and 1/2 cups flour, plus more as necessary

Extra virgin olive oil

**Creamy Sage Sauce:**

4 ounces pancetta, diced

4 tablespoons butter

1 shallot, peeled and minced

4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

10 sage leaves

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

*\*To strain the ricotta cheese, simply line a sieve with paper towels and place the ricotta cheese in the sieve and let set over a bowl for at least 1 hour.*

# Method

**Prepare the Sweet Potatoes:**

Prick the sweet potatoes all over with a fork. Wrap with a damp paper towel and microwave for 10 minutes. If the sweet potatoes aren’t soft enough, microwave for another 5-6 minutes. *Note: You can also roast these in the oven if you prefer, but it will take closer to an hour or so.*

Cut the sweet potatoes open and transfer to the fridge to cool for 10 minutes.

**Prepare the Gnocchi Base:**

While the sweet potatoes are cooling, combine the ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, and salt and mix to combine.

Remove the skins from the sweet potatoes and add the sweet potato flesh to the bowl of cheese. Using a hand mixer or a potato masher, mix until very smooth and combined.

Add the flour to the sweet potato mixture and, using your hands, combine the flour with the sweet potatoes. Continue adding the flour, kneading the dough after each addition, until combine. Be careful not to over-mix the gnocchi dough. Once the dough is fairly smooth and easy to handle, transfer it to a floured surface.

**Prepare the Gnocchi:**

Form the gnocchi into a large loaf and cut, cross-wise, into 2” thick slices.

Roll each slice into a long rope. Cut the rope into 1” pieces. *Note: You may want to pat each piece of gnocchi into a bit of the flour on your work surface.*

Transfer the gnocchi to a pan and keep them in an even layer. *Trust me, don’t put them in a bowl. I learned the hard way.*

**Boil the Gnocchi:**

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and boil until they float. Drain and toss with a bit of extra virgin olive oil to keep them from sticking.

*At this point, you should figure whether you want to make half or all the gnocchi. You can boil all the gnocchi or you can freeze* [*half*](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/gnocchi-101335) *and boil half.*

**Fry the Gnocchi:**

In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium heat until melted and frothy. Add the gnocchi, in batches if necessary, and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until well-browned. Divide the warm gnocchi between 4 bowls.

**Prepare the Creamy Sage Sauce:**

Add the diced pancetta to the skillet and cook for 5 minutes over medium heat and cook until crispy and browned. Next, add the diced shallot and cook for an additional 5-6 minutes until softened and browned.

Turn the heat to low and add the garlic and sage leaves. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.

**Finish the Creamy Sage Sauce:**

Stir the heavy cream and parmesan into the sauce and whisk until combined. Cook over very low heat for 1-2 minutes until thickened. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat.

**To Serve:**

Spoon the warm sauce over the cooked gnocchi. Enjoy!"

The chocolate truffles and Biscoff truffles can be decorated with any simple ingredients that we have available.

Recipe video link is [here](https://youtu.be/xeynxXo9pdg)

**Ingredients:**

*--Biscoff cheesecake truffles-- (8 pcs)*

56 g (¼ cup) cream cheese

100 g (14 pcs) Lotus Biscoff cookies

*--Chocolate truffles--* *(16 pcs)*

200 g (7 ounces) dark chocolate, roughly chopped

150 g (½ cup + 2 tbsp) heavy whipping cream

1-2 tbsp brandy (optional)

*--Coating--*

150 g (5.3 ounces) white chocolate (melting wafer or couverture)

150 g (5.3 ounces) dark chocolate (melting wafer or couverture)

A handful of hazelnuts, chopped small

A spoonful of cocoa powder

A spoonful of Lotus Biscoff crumbs

**Instructions:**

*--Biscoff cheesecake truffles--*

1. Crush the lotus biscoff into fine crumbs.

2. Combine the crumbs with cream cheese. It should come together into a dough ball.

3. Portion into 8 equal pieces (about 20g per piece). Roll each into a round ball. Refrigerate while preparing the chocolate coating.

*--White chocolate coating--*

1. Melt the chocolate over a double-boiler (bain-marie). Or heat it in a microwave over medium heat for 20 seconds. Stir the chocolate, then return into the microwave and repeat the process with 20 seconds intervals.

2. Insert a skewer into the center of each biscoff truffle. Dip it into the melted chocolate until completely covered. Gently tap and let the excess coating drip off. Quickly sprinkle some biscoff crumbs before the chocolate sets. Place upright into a styrofoam block or a corrugated box. Refrigerate until the chocolate sets completely.

3. Pull out each skewer once the chocolate has set.

*--Chocolate truffles--*

1. Heat the whipping cream until almost boiled. Pour it into the chopped chocolate, making sure they are fully submerged. Let sit for 2 minutes before stirring. Add brandy (if using) and combine well. The chocolate should be completely melted. Place a plastic wrap directly on the surface (to prevent condensation) and set it in the fridge for 1-2 hours.

2. After the chocolate has set but still soft and scoopable, portion it into 16 equal pieces (about 20g per piece). Roll into balls. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before coating.

*--Dark chocolate coating--*

1. Melt the chocolate over a double-boiler (bain-marie). Or heat it in a microwave over medium heat for 20 seconds. Stir the chocolate, then return into the microwave and repeat the process with 20 seconds intervals.

2. Insert a skewer into the center of each chocolate truffle. Dip it into the melted chocolate until completely covered. Gently tap and let the excess coating drip off. Place upright into a styrofoam block or a corrugated box. Refrigerate until the chocolate sets completely.

3. Pull out each skewer once the chocolate has set. Decorate by piping a few stripes of melted chocolate onto the top.

*--Chocolate hazelnut coating--*

1. Chop the hazelnuts into small pieces. Add them into the remaining melted chocolate (from the ""dark chocolate coating"" section). Coat the chocolate truffle using the same process.

*--Cocoa powder coating--*

1. Simply roll the chocolate truffle into the cocoa powder to coat it evenly."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jem3j5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jem3j5,reddit,"Reganmian is a traditional Chinese dish where noodles are served with flavourful beef stock - lou mei and other garnishes like crushed peanuts, pickled carrots or beans, sesame sauce, soy sauce, fresh garlic, chilli oil, coriander and scallions.

Noodles are the main element of this dish so making fresh is the best way to go. My favourite is Udon, easy to make and tastes fantastic, I bet you will enjoy it as much as I did at the moment when everything mixes together and you take the first bite.

You don't have to add all of the toppings to make it delicious. Instead of chilli oil, I used my homemade chilli sauce and it worked great. I also pickled carrot with my quick hot pickle.

**Ingredients for Udon:**

* 500g (17.6oz) of plain flour
* 250g (8.8oz) of warm water
* 20g (0.7oz) of salt
* cornstarch for dusting

**Ingredients for lou mei:**

* 400ml (0.42quarts) of beef or stock
* 3tbsp sesame oil
* 20g (0.7oz) of fresh ginger peeled and sliced
* 3 garlic cloves peeled and sliced
* 1 small shallot sliced
* 1spring onion sliced
* 3tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1tbsp brown sugar

**Spices for lou mei:**

* 2 small cinnamon sticks
* 3 bay leaves
* 10 peppercorns
* 20 fennel seeds
* 10 cloves
* 5 cardamon pods
* 3 star anise

📷📷

**Instructions for Noodles (4 portions) :**

**1.** Dissolve the salt in warm water and mix into the flour, knead for **8 minutes** until a smooth dough ball is formed (it may be hard at the beginning but it will soften as gluten forms) Then rest it covered to prevent drying for **30 minutes**.

📷📷

**2.** After resting it is time for final kneading and the easiest way to get it done is by placing the dough in a plastic bag and stepping on it until it spreads out then folding it into a ball again and repeating this two more times. You can also roll it with a pin but it is a lot harder to do so. After you finish rest the dough for at least **2 hours or overnight**.

**3.** Roll the dough flat to **1/4 of an inch** then fold it on itself and slice equal noodles.

**4.** Boil the noodles in salty water for **12 minutes** (do it in 3 batches) then run them  under cold water to set the starch on the outer surface (this makes them silkier and prevents from sticking)

**5.** To serve the noodles, deep them in boiling water for **15 seconds** then place in the bowl, add a small ladle of lou mei and garnish with other toppings.

**Instructions for Lou mei:**

**1.** Heat **3tbsp of sesame oil** in a medium pan then add, garlic, ginger and onion. Fry for couple minutes then add seven spices, fry for another couple minutes to release the aroma.

**2.** Add Shaoxing wine, beef stock and brown sugar then simmer for about **30-60 minutes.**

**3.** Once ready you can store in the fridge for up to 4 days.

 **Quick Pickled Carrot:**

* 100g (3.5oz) carrot, peeled and chopped into matchsticks
* 100ml (0.1quarts) of red wine vinegar
* 50g (1.8oz) of brown sugar

Combine vinegar and sugar then bring to boil and remove from the heat, add carrot matchsticks and make sure it is submerged. After 15 minutes the pickle is ready, you can store it in the fridge for future use.

📷📷  
**Homemade Chilli sauce:**

* 5 chillis (green or red) seeds removed
* 20g (0.7oz) of ginger, peeled and diced
* 8tbsp of chopped tomato
* 1/2 lime juice
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4tbsp rapeseed oil

Blend everything together in a food processor, it makes more than you need for this recipe so you can store it for the future in the fridge.

For full recipe and lots of tips & tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/what-is-risotto-mushroom-risotto/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/what-is-risotto-mushroom-risotto/)

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Risotto

* 1 c Arborio rice
* 2 Tbsp butter, divided
* 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 c dry white wine
* 4 c beef stock, warmed up (I use Knorr bouillon cubes)
* 1/2 c freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* Kosher salt, as needed

#### Mushrooms

* 8 oz baby portobello (aka baby bellas, cremini, etc), thinly sliced to 1/4""
* 1 Tbsp butter
* 1 to 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 c shallots or yellow onion, chopped
* 1 Tbsp minced garlic
* 1 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp thyme and/or sage
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/2 c roughly chopped flat leaf Italian parsley

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Basic Risotto

* Heat 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil in a saucepan until you hear a light sizzle and the butter begins to bubble.
* Add 1 c of Arborio rice and stir evenly and thoroughly.
* After a minute or so – when the rice gets glossy (not brown), add 1/2 c of dry white wine and keep stirring. 
* Once the wine starts to bubble, it will be absorbed quickly (within about 2 minutes), so make sure you have 4 c of beef stock warmed and ready. Add one ladle of stock at a time and stir. Adjust the heat so it’s barely boiling. Just a couple bubbles here and there.
* Once the liquid is absorbed, add another ladle of stock, stir, and repeat. Watch, smell, and taste. From adding the first ladle to the last, it takes about 25 minutes from start to finish. Taste, but be careful with adding salt too soon. The stock will add additional salt, and so will the salty Parmigiano Reggiano. 
* When the rice is done, add (at least) 1 Tbsp butter and (at least) 1/2 c of Parmigiano Reggiano (the good stuff). Stir for about 2 minutes and add a couple cranks of black pepper (1/4 tsp).

#### Mushroom Risotto

* Heat 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. 
* Add 1/4 c chopped shallots and cook for 2 minutes until translucent.
* Add 8 oz sliced mushrooms, 1 Tbsp minced garlic, 1 tsp dry thyme and/or sage, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper. Stir occasionally and cook (simmer) for about 8 minutes. 
* Once the mushrooms have absorbed all the liquids, taste them and add more salt if necessary. Remove from the saucepan and set aside. 
* **Next, cook the risotto as outlined in the Basic Risotto recipe above.**
* Once the risotto is ready in its creamy deliciousness, put the cooked mushrooms back in the risotto and stir it all together.
* Sprinkle with some roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley and pour yourself a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. You deserve it. "

Time: 25 mins

Makes: 4 servings (pictured is 2 servings, 1/2 batch)

Original recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-gnocchi-in-pumpkin-sauce/](https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-gnocchi-in-pumpkin-sauce/) 

**Ingredients**

* 7.5 oz pumpkin purée, half of a standard 15 oz can
* 1 lb gnocchi, from 1 standard package
* ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for topping
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, optional, for topping
* ¼ cup half-and-half
* 1 cup chicken or veggie stock
* 3 tbsp salted butter
* 1 tbsp light brown sugar
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ⅛ tsp ground thyme optional
* ⅛ tsp ground nutmeg
* ¼ tsp salt

**Instructions** 

1. Dissolve the cornstarch in the chicken/veggie stock. Make sure your parmesan is grated and ready to go.
2. Melt 2 tbsp of butter in a medium skillet over medium to medium-low heat. Add the gnocchi, breaking up any that are stuck together. Toss until all the pieces are lightly coated in butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the gnocchi is golden and crispy on the outside, and soft in the center, about 10 minutes. (Note, you start with gnocchi straight out of the package, don't boil them first!)
3. Meanwhile, melt 1 tbsp of butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Once melted, stir frequently until the butter browns and gives off a nutty smell, about 1 to 3 minutes depending on the temp of your stove. Once the butter is lightly browned, add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 more minute.
4. Quickly add the pumpkin to the skillet and mix to incorporate it into the butter and garlic mixture. Add the stock/cornstarch mixture and half-and-half, and bring the skillet to a simmer.
5. Allow the pumpkin mixture to cook down, stirring occasionally, until the consistency is similar to the photos, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, add the brown sugar, ground thyme, salt, and ground nutmeg. Remove from heat and mix in the grated parm, stir until it is fully melted and incorporated.
6. Plate the pumpkin sauce directly onto the serving dish, then top with crispy gnocchi. Add a little fresh thyme and grated parm if desired, and serve immediately.

## Ingredients

* 1 clove of garlic halved
* 2 tbsp butter softened
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 tsp fresh thyme roughly chopped
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg optional
* 2 tbsp chives chopped, divided
* 1/2 tsp salt or to taste

* 1 cup gruyere cheese shredded
* 2 lbs yellow potatoes sliced into about 1/8"" (3mm) thin rounds

## Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 400F. Grab the halved garlic and rub it, cut-side-down, all over the bottom and sides of a 10 or 11"" cast iron skillet. Discard any garlic leftover. Spread the butter evenly all over the bottom and sides of the skillet.
* Whisk the heavy cream, milk, thyme, nutmeg, 1 tbsp of the chives, salt, and pepper together in a large mixing bowl. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt if needed. Add the sliced potatoes to the mixture, making sure each slice gets coated well.
* Take about 1/3 of the potato slices and lay them in an even layer into the prepared skillet. Sprinkle half of the shredded gruyere over the potatoes. Add another layer of potatoes, the rest of the gruyere, then top with the rest of the potatoes.
* Pour the remaining cream mixture in the mixing bowl evenly into the skillet. Cover the skillet with foil and bake for 1 hour, until the potatoes are tender. Remove the foil and sprinkle the parmesan cheese evenly over the potatoes. Bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Garnish with remaining chives and serve."

These tenders are ultra crispy and flavorful and juicy. Just as long as you don't fuss over them too much. My dad says the key to these chicken tenders is to **just not give a shit.** My mom says the key is to make sure your tenders are well-coated with flour and that the pan is the right heat. Here's my mom's recommendations for checking the heat: ""Check your pan, it should be getting hot, so up your heat from low to medium high and wait until it's hot enough that a drop of water will cause a nice sizzle but not a popping sizzle.....grease in your eye is too hot.""

I served these chicken tenders with Dukkah-Spiced Sweet Potatoes and a Horseradish-Honey Mustard. All three recipes are included in this post. Enjoy!

Serves: 6 or so

Cost: Approximately $3.51 per serving.*

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 60 minutes (for the entire meal)

**CHICKEN TENDERS**

2 pounds chicken tenders (or, boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into strips)

1/2 cup buttermilk

4 eggs

2 cups flour

Salt, pepper, cayenne powder to taste

Flaky Sea Salt for Serving

Canola Oil (I used half a cup)

**HORSERADISH-HONEY MUSTARD**

1/4 cup spicy brown mustard

2 teaspoons prepared horseradish

2 teaspoons honey

Salt and pepper to taste

**DUKKAH-SPICED SWEET POTATOES**

4 sweet potatoes

Salt and pepper to taste

Olive oil

2 tablespoons maple syrup

2 teaspoons Dukkah (Plus more for garnish)

Prep Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Medium dice the sweet potatoes.

**Chicken Tenders:** In a shallow dish, whisk the buttermilk and four eggs. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne powder and continue whisking until smooth. In a gallon freezer bag, combine flour, salt, pepper, and cayenne powder.

Place a large skillet with the canola oil on the stove and heat on low as you dredge the tenders to warm up the oil.

Add all the chicken tenders to the buttermilk and egg mixture and use tongs to evenly coat all of them. Add about 5 of the tenders to the freezer bag with the flour and seal it. Shake the bag around to evenly coat the tenders with the flour.

Turn the heat up to medium high for a few minutes. Add a tiny drop of water to see if it sizzles. If it sizzles, begin frying the chicken. Add the chicken tenders, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 6-7 minutes or until very golden brown on the bottom. Flip and continue frying another 6-7 minutes or until completely golden brown all over. Note: the first batch will take the longest since your oil isn't super hot yet. The rest will go more quickly.

Once the first batch is golden brown all over, transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. Continue frying the rest of the tenders in batches. Adding a line of paper towels between each layer of tenders to soak up the excess grease. After each batch, sprinkle a bit of flaky sea salt on top of the finished tenders if desired. Keep warm.

**Dukkah-Spiced Sweet Potatoes:** Add olive oil to a roasting pan and toss the chopped sweet potatoes in the oil. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes, drizzle the maple syrup on the potatoes and carefully toss to coat. Bake an additional 10 minutes.

Remove from the pan and sprinkle the dukkah on the potatoes. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with a bit more dukkah on top.

**Horseradish-Honey Mustard:** In a saucepan, combine the horseradish, honey, and mustard and cook over low heat until well combined and thickened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to one or two small bowls, depending on how many people will be eating.

**To Serve:** Bring the chicken tenders to the table along with the honey mustard and sweet potatoes and serve family-style. Enjoy!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/flsz6l,https://i.redd.it/sr4pfuo84tn41.jpg,reddit,"Banana cake with cream cheese frosting:

Cake ingredients:

4 very ripe medium bananas (peeled weight around 400g)

3 teaspoons of lemon juice (squeezy bottle is fine)

450g plain (AP) flour, plus an extra dessert spoon for your baking tray

1½ level teaspoons bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)

200g room temperature, softened butter, plus 1 heaped teaspoon for your baking tray (keep the butter wrapper for this) – I used unsalted

0.5 level teaspoon fine salt (reduce to ¼ teaspoon if your butter is salted)

400g white sugar (caster/fine, if possible, but granulated will also work)

3 large eggs at room temperature

2 teaspoons of good vanilla extract

425ml buttermilk (or 300ml of natural yoghurt, mixed with 125ml of milk works perfectly too)

Frosting:

500g full fat cream cheese

250g icing (confectioners) sugar

(There is no need for additional butter!)

Optional: about 10 walnuts, broken into ¼ ‘s

Method:

Take a baking tray which is roughly 26cm x 36cm x 7cm deep (10” x 14” x 2.5”). Using your butter wrapper and a heaped teaspoon of softened butter, smear the butter thoroughly around your baking tray.  Sprinkle in the dessert spoon of flour and shake / rotate / turn your tray so it has an even coating of flour.  Tip out any excess.  Set aside.

Mash your bananas thoroughly and mix in the lemon juice.  Set aside.

Add your butter and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer with the balloon whisk attachment. You can also use an electric hand whisk with the double beaters and a large mixing bowl.

Whisk on high for around 10 minutes, scraping down the bowl regularly.  The mixture will look very sandy to begin with, but will eventually succumb and become almost white and fluffy. It does take a little while to reach this stage and don’t worry if the mixture still seems a little grainy, providing it is white and fluffy, it will be fine.

Now HEAT YOUR OVEN TO 135C / 275F

While your sugar and butter are becoming one, take a medium sized bowl and add your flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt.  Mix and set aside.

With the mixer still running (turn down to a medium speed), crack one egg into a small bowl and add to your butter/sugar. Once incorporated, turn up the speed a little and beat thoroughly, for around 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl.  If you add the eggs too quickly, your batter will split, so you need to allow enough time for it to fully emulsify with the butter before adding your next egg.  Add the second egg and again, mix thoroughly for another 2 minutes. Then repeat with the third egg.

If you are using a stand mixer, switch to a paddle beater for the next stage.  If you are using electric hand beaters, keep the speed low from now on.  Over-zealous mixing will activate the gluten in the flour (which we are about to add), resulting in a heavier cake.

Now bring your flour mixture and buttermilk to the mixer.  You are going to add a little of each to the batter alternately, mixing between each addition.  So now add around 3 tablespoons of flour, then pour in a drop of buttermilk (or yoghurt mixture).  Gently mix to incorporate.  Repeat until all the flour and buttermilk have been mixed in. This should only take a minute or so – once the bicarb is added (which is in the flour), you really want to get your cake into the oven as quickly as possible because it will now be active.

Now add your mashed bananas and mix to incorporate.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking tin and put into your preheated oven on the lower-middle shelf.

The size of your baking pan – if it’s slightly smaller / larger will determine the exact time it takes to cook. Mine took 50 minutes, so set a timer for 45 minutes and keep a small eye on it.  The top should be beautifully golden and it should have risen evenly – take a toothpick or a wooden skewer and plunge into the center – if it comes out relatively clean, your cake is ready.  If it emerges a little sticky, then cook for another 5 minutes and check again.

Once cooked, remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tray.

Frosting:

Using a fork, loosen your cream cheese if it is very stiff.  Add the icing (powder) sugar and mix to incorporate (there is no need to sieve unless it is very hard and lumpy). I prefer my frosting a little less sweet – check you are happy with the taste and add more sugar, if you like.

Remove your cooled cake by running a spatula around the edges, place a board over the top of your tray, tip upside down and give it a sharp shake to dislodge onto the board.

Spread your frosting over the surface and decorate with pieces of walnut (if using).

The cake will keep well, covered in the fridge for around 5 days!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/mfmad0,https://i.redd.it/regaqumkzxp61.png,reddit,"This is a really detailed recipe to make sure your Turkish coffee is frothy and foamy, as it's meant to be. 

Here's my more visual, sub 5-minute how-to on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZJHKBH9nS8).

**Equipment:**

Turkish coffee pot (known as a cezve, jezve, or ibrik). Use a copper-plated one, like the one in the link, as it spreads out heat better. 

Espresso cup (make sure it’s got a saucer, for a optional cube of Turkish delight) 

Teaspoon

Piece of wood for stirring, such as kebab stick, chopstick, or toothpick
Stove/oven top, preferably gas, but electric and induction also works

**Ingredients:** 

* Turkish coffee grounds (or VERY finely ground coffee beans, a level finer than espresso, medium roast. You can use a pestle and mortar to grind your coffee)

* Water

* Optional: Brown or white sugar

* Optional : Turkish delight (My favourite flavours are rose and pistachio, especially pistachio. I’ve linked to my favourite flavour of my favourite Turkish delight brand, Koska. Whichever brand of Turkish delight you buy, make sure it’s actually made in Turkey) 


**Directions:**


>1. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one heaped teaspoon of coffee grounds.** Put a heaped, overflowing teaspoon of Turkish coffee (or just really fine coffee grounds) in the jezve, the Turkish coffee pot. Or, if you’re making two cups, you need two teaspoons of coffee, and so on. Why? If you don’t use a really heaped teaspoon of coffee, there won’t be enough concentration of oils for the crema. Make sure you use fairly fresh coffee — which means coffee grounds that haven’t been sitting around for more than a month, otherwise those oils will have dried up.



>2. **‘Toast’ the coffee.** Put the coffee pot on the very smallest ring on your stovetop. If you don’t use the smallest ring, you’ll waste energy and likely cook your coffee too fast. Turn on to a low to medium heat. Why? Although you’ve only got coffee grounds in your pot, and no water yet, turning the heat on now for a few seconds helps ‘toast’ or warm the grounds, which gives off a pleasing aroma and helps develop the flavour. You can also add sugar at this step. Use one teaspoon for mildly sweet coffee, and two teaspoons (or more) for sweet coffee. I personally don’t add sugar, because I like the Turkish coffee’s bitter flavour.


>3. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one espresso cup of water.** Now, you’ll add the water. The rule is one cup of water for one cup of coffee. Use your espresso cup to measure the right amount of water. Make sure to run the tap first, so you’re using fresh water. Why? Fresh water is more likely to be aerated from having just run through the faucet — so this will help your coffee have a more bubbly crema.


>4. **Shallow-stir the Turkish coffee with a piece of wood.** Stir the coffee using a piece of wood. Why? Stirring with a piece of wood apparently avoids damage to the metal of the jezve. I use a kebab stick — but any piece of wood will do, like a toothpick or a chopstick. Using a thin piece of wood also stops too many of the grounds sticking to it, instead of staying in your jezve. To help the coffee grounds dissolve into the water, you’ll want to stir just the floating grounds of coffee at the top. Don’t over-stir the coffee, as this will make the bubbles disappear, meaning your coffee will be less frothy. Many people prefer to hardly stir the coffee at all — giving it only three to six stirs.


>5. **Let the Turkish coffee brew.** I advise a medium low heat, so that you don’t cook the coffee too fast. However, any heat will do — but of course, the lower the heat, the longer you’ll have to wait for your delicious cup of Turkish coffee!


>6. **Keep your eye on the Turkish coffee as it brews**. While a watched pot never boils, an unwatched Turkish coffee pot boils instantly. I can’t keep track of the number of times my Turkish coffee’s boiled over — and remember, if it’s reached boiling point, you’ll need to start over again.  Why? Turkish coffee needs to be heated to around 99°C, or 210°F. Any hotter, and it’ll extremely quickly lose its crema and flavour, and taste ashy. More later on temperature — and knowing when it’s ready.


>7. **Slowly rotate the jezve, while tapping it with a spoon.** What’s very important not to do is deep-stir the Turkish coffee. Why? This will make all the grounds rise to the top. As you don’t filter Turkish coffee, if you stir your coffee at this stage, while it’s brewing, all the coffee sediment at the bottom will rise to the top — leading to a gritty and unpleasant mouthfeel. But what you do want to do is very gently introduce any remaining undissolved grounds to the water, which will now be hot. To do this, slowly rotate the jezve while it’s on the stovetop, and tap the outside of the jezve with a teaspoon. 10–15 taps of a teaspoon, and three to four gentle rotations of the jezve will do.


>8. **As the bubbles slowly start to rise, prepare to remove the jezve from the heat.** This is the most crucial moment of your Turkish coffee brewing — wait too long, and the coffee will start to boil, which, as mentioned earlier, will ruin the flavour and crema almost instantly. If you’ve used reasonably fresh coffee that’s not been sitting around more than a month, you will see bubbles start to rise, usually around the outer edge. Often, the bubbles will not rise evenly. If you see a part of the crema that’s not so well formed, move the jezve to apply more heat to that part. This is a lot easier with a gas stove than electric or induction — but if you don’t have a gas stove, you can simply tilt the jezve towards the stove ring on the part that needs a more foamy, developed crema. Remember: stay on the side of caution. A slightly under-brewed Turkish coffee will taste far better than a burned, over-brewed one. When you see the bubbles suddenly speed up, rising up the inside of the jezve, that’s a sign you need to take the jezve off the heat, right now


>9. **Pour the coffee into the espresso cup slowly, and never pour from a height.** Why? If you pour from a height, you’ll disturb your crema, and cause it to ‘dissolve’ into the coffee. Pour slowly, and in stages. The crema will likely appear on the top of you espresso cup when you’re about halfway through pouring. If you’ve made more than one cup of Turkish coffee, you’re going to want to divide the foam democratically — after all, the crema is the bit everyone wants to see! To divide the foam democratically, pour some of the coffee in the first cup, and then some in the second cup, and then repeat until you’ve poured all the coffee from the jezve to the cups.  One common technique calls for skimming the crema from the jezve with a teaspoon first, and placing that in the espresso cup, and then pouring the coffee, but this isn’t necessary if you’ve taken the time to pour the coffee alternately in each cup.


>10. **Enjoy! And don’t drink down to the dregs.** In life, you don’t want to scrape the bottom of the barrel. And with Turkish coffee, never drink the bottom few millimetres. It’s where the coffee grit, or sediment, lives — and where the grit needs to stay until it’s time to wash up. Some people like to tell their fortune by looking at the grounds — but I personally prefer to spend my time making ever-better Turkish coffee. 

Now is also the time to eat that optional piece of Turkish delight, which is particularly desirable if you’ve not added sugar to your coffee — as remember, Turkish coffee is bitter!

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan, or line it with parchment paper for easier removal.
2. **Prepare the Batter:** In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together using an electric mixer or stand mixer until pale and fluffy. This may take about 5-7 minutes.
3. **Add Vanilla Extract:** Stir in the vanilla extract until well combined.
4. **Sift Dry Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
5. **Incorporate Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the sifted dry ingredients to the egg mixture, gently folding with a spatula until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the batter.
6. **Transfer to Pan:** Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly with a spatula.
7. **Bake:** Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. **Cool:** Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool completely.
9. **Topping:** Once cooled, slice the sponge cake and layer it with lots of nutella and crushed walnuts. Enjoy !"

I originally posted the recipe [on my blog](http://whiskwhiskers.com/2020/05/09/apple-brie-and-arugula-pizza-with-honey/). I hope you like it!

### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 batch pizza dough
* Cornmeal for sprinkling
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Salt to taste
* 4 ounces shredded mozzarella
* 4 ounces brie cut into strips, rind trimmed
* 1 small HoneyCrisp apple or your favorite sweet-ish, tart-ish apple
* 1/2 lemon
* 2 cups fresh arugula
* 1/4 cup shaved Parmesan
* Honey for drizzling

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Preheat oven to 550F. If you have a pizza stone, place the stone in the oven while it preheats, and for best results, let it sit in the hot oven about 30 minutes before making the pizza.
* If you have a pizza peel, on a large sheet of parchment paper, sprinkle a generous amount of cornmeal. If you don't have a pizza peel, sprinkle the cornmeal onto whatever baking sheet you're baking the pizza on. Use your hands to stretch the pizza dough until it's about a 12 inch circle. It's okay if it isn't a perfect circle, mine certainly never it! Place the circle onto your baking sheet or parchment paper. Let it rest for a few minutes while you prep the apple.
* Peel the apple, remove the core, and slice it into thin matchsticks. Toss apple sticks in a bowl with the juice of 1/2 lemon, and set aside.
* Brush the dough with the olive oil until the entire dough has been brushed with oil. Be sure not to put so much oil onto the pizza that it's pooling up in places, otherwise the pizza will get too greasy. You may use more or less than the 2 tablespoons, it's okay to eyeball it a bit.
* Sprinkle salt over the dough. Next, sprinkle the mozzarella evenly over the dough, leaving a border for the crust. Evenly distribute the brie slices over the pizza.
* Transfer the pizza to the oven, onto the pizza stone if you have one. If you're baking on a pizza stone the pizza will cook a bit quicker, in about 5-6 minutes. If you don't have a stone, it will cook in about 7-9 minutes. Be sure to keep an eye on the pizza, the oven is really hot so it will cook quickly! Once the crust is slightly golden and puffed, and the cheese has browned a bit, remove from the oven.
* Let the pizza cool for 5 minutes, then top with the apple matchsticks. Evenly sprinkle the arugula over the pizza, then top with fresh arugula. Sprinkle shaved Parmesan over the pizza, and top it off with an even drizzle of honey over the whole pie.
* Slice, serve, and enjoy!"

Full recipe: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/chinese-braised-soy-sauce-chicken/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/chinese-braised-soy-sauce-chicken/)

# Ingredients

* 3 lbs chicken drumsticks skin-on and bone-in (or chicken thighs)
* 3 stalks scallions
* 4 cloves garlic (lightly smashed)
* ½ inch ginger (sliced)
* ½ cup light soy sauce
* ¼ cup dark soy sauce
* ¼ cup Shaoxing wine
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* ¼ cup brown sugar
* ½ cup water
* 2 star anise
* 3 bay leaves

# Instructions

1. Remove chicken from package and pat dry with a paper towel. You will get the best crisp when there is less moisture on the outside of the chicken.
2. Add a neutral oil to a heavy-bottomed pot (such as a dutch oven) and saute sliced ginger, garlic cloves, and the white parts of the scallion on medium heat.
3. When the garlic cloves start to lightly brown (about 1-2 minutes), add the chicken.
4. Ensure that each piece of chicken gets its own surface area and that there is little to no crowding. None of the chicken should be overlapping.
5. When the bottom side is light golden brown, flip to brown the other side.
6. When both sides are browned, add both soy sauces, sesame oil, Shaoxing wine, brown sugar, and water. Let brown sugar dissolve into the liquid and add star anise and bay leaves.
7. Allow the liquid to come to a bubbling simmer and turn the heat to low. Place lid on the pot and let simmer for 35 minutes. Flip the chicken at around 15 minutes to ensure that both sides are simmered in the sauce.
8. Add in the green parts of the scallion and you're ready to serve.
9. Spoon some of the soy sauce mixture on top of a big bowl of rice before topping off with a serving of chicken."

Recipe:
- Cook 20 lasagna noodles until slightly undercooked.
- Chop up 1 large vidalia onion.
- Heat 2 TBSP of canola oil on medium heat in large saucepan while chopping onion.
- Add onion, cook for 5 min stirring often so it doesn’t brown.
- Add 2-5 minced garlic cloves, cook for 1-2 min.
- Add 1 lb ground meat (I used 1/3 beef, 1/3 pork, 1/3 veal; I found it prepackaged at the grocery store as “meatball” or “meatloaf mix.”)
- Cook on medium-high heat until brown while breaking down meat into bits.
- Add 2 tsp each of salt, pepper, and dry Italian seasoning.
- Optional: Add 1/3 cup heavy cream if it’s around, but definitely not necessary.
- Add 1 large can (28 oz) of tomato sauce and 1 large can of crushed tomato to saucepan and stir. There’s nothing wrong with using your favorite jarred tomato sauce as long as you have enough of it! 56 ounces total. 
- You also want to have CHICKEN STOCK on hand and add it to the sauce to keep the sauce from getting thick. It’s 100x better to have sauce on thin side than thick. You still need to put it in the oven where it will lose even more moisture.
- Bring to a boil then turn heat to low.
- Cover with lid, but leave it open slightly to allow some steam to escape while it simmers.
- Simmer on low stirring every 5-10 min. The more it’s boiling, the more often you want to stir. Simmer for as long as it takes you to make ricotta mixture below.
- Meanwhile in separate bowl add together: 20 ounces ricotta, 1/4 cup chopped parsley, 1 whisked egg, 1 cup  shredded Parmesan (from the block of ya wanna get fancy with it), 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper. Stir it all up.
- Lightly grease bottom and sides of lasagna dish with canola oil, add 1/3 cup of the sauce to dish and spread evenly over the bottom.
- THEN Layer accordingly:
- 1: Pasta, ricotta, 1 cup mozz, sauce.
- 2: Pasta, ricotta, 1 cup mozz, sauce.
- 3: Pasta, ricotta, 1 cup mozz, sauce.
- 4: Ricotta, pasta, sauce, 1 cup mozz.

Bake, covered, at 375 for 30 minutes then bake uncovered for 20 min. Remove lasagna and let it sit for 15-20 minutes to allow everything to solidify a bit. Enjoy!!

Edit: undercook the pasta, pull it out a minute or 2 early because it’s going to cook more in the oven. Also, if you start to run low on sauce while layering, just add chicken stock to sauce and simmer it a bit. This will extend the sauce. Changed quantity of ricotta. Changed ”sausage” to “pork.”"

Otherwise, here's my recipe:

**Ingredients**  
2lb Large Shrimp  
20oz Smoked Sausage, sliced  
8 Corn Cob Halves  
5-6 Large Red Potatoes, cut into small pieces (about 1"")  
4 Garlic Bulbs, tip cut off  
4 Tablespoons Olive Oil  
4 Tablespoons Crab Boil  
4 Tablespoons Parsley, freshly chopped  
**Instructions**  
If you are using a charcoal grill, go ahead and light your coals and let them get red.  
Cut 8 pieces of foil (each about 24""). Lay 2 pieces down on top of each other.  
Take 1 Tablespoon of the olive oil and pour it on the top side of the foil.  
Using your fingers rub that oil all over that foil surface.  
Take 1 quarter of the ingredients - 2 pieces of corn, 1 garlic bulb, some potatoes, shrimp and sausage and place over on one side of the foil.  
Take 1 Tablespoon of the crab boil and sprinkle all over the ingredients.  
Close the other side of the foil over the top of the ingredients. Crimp all sides closed and make sure there are no seams open.  
Repeat this process with the other three foil packets.  
Lay the foil packets on the grill and allow to cook for 15 minutes (+/-) turning the packets half way.  
After you remove them from the grill, open up and sprinkle with the tablespoon of parsley and add lemon wedges to serve.  
**Notes**  
The amount of spice in boiled shrimp is a personal preference. You may feel like 1 tablespoon of crab boil is not enough. Feel free to add more as required. (or less).  
  
Make sure the potatoes are small in size as they will not cook in time. If you prefer your potatoes bigger perhaps try partially cooking them first."

I made a few changes. I added chopped carrots with the broccoli instead of the matchstick carrots. I also sauteed a cubed chicken breast in olive oil, salt, and chinese five spice before starting. I added that in with the rice and sauce. 

 

### Ingredients

* 3 large eggs beaten
* 1 medium head broccoli chopped
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Kosher salt to taste
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter divided
* ⅓ cup soy sauce
* ¼ cup oyster sauce
* 2 tablespoons garlic paste
* 2 cups already cooked and cooled rice
* ¼ cup matchstick carrots
* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
* 2 bunches of scallions
* Sprinkle of sesame seeds

### Instructions

1. Preheat a large skillet or wok over medium heat.
2. While the pan is heating, beat three eggs in a separate bowl.
3. Chop up a medium head of broccoli and toss in olive oil and kosher salt to taste. Set aside.
4. Once the pan is hot, add in 1 tablespoon of the unsalted butter. Once melted, add in the eggs.
5. Lightly scramble the eggs with a rubber spatula until just set and then place in a separate bowl.
6. Add in the broccoli and saute for about 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon to ensure the broccoli doesn’t burn. Cook until bright green and getting tender.
7. While the broccoli is cooking, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce and garlic paste until homogenous.
8. Turn the heat up to medium high heat and add the remaining butter, all the rice and the soy sauce mixture. Be sure to mix well and evenly coat the rice with the sauce. Make sure that the rice has maximum contact with the bottom of the pan. This will give you great texture and flavor. Toss the rice mixture every minute or so to ensure it doesn’t burn and the flavors continue to develop.
9. After about 3-4 minutes, the rice should have darkened a bit in color and become caramelized and a little crispy. Turn off the heat and add in carrots. Continue to toss the rice to warm up the carrots
10. Add in the scrambled eggs and break up with wooden spoon. Drizzle with sesame oil and give the fried rice a final mix.
11. Portion out the rice onto plates or into bowls. To finish, quickly chop up two bunches of fresh scallions using both the white and green parts. Add a sprinkle of scallions and sesame seeds to each bowl and enjoy.

### Notes

* You should really make the rice before hand and cool in the fridge overnight. However, in a pinch you can make rice according to the package instructions and put it on a sheet tray in the freezer for 15 minutes. You want cold and dried out rice.
* You can make it with whatever rice you have on hand (white rice, sushi rice, brown rice, jasmine rice) just make sure it’s cooled and dried out a little.
* Add whatever veggies you have leftover in the fridge. Pea pods, frozen peas, onions, peppers, mushrooms would all be delightful.
* Feel free to add in already cooked protein like chicken, pork, beef or shrimp to bulk this up.
* Store for three to four days in an airtight container in the fridge. Great for meal prep lunches if paired with an Asian inspired protein like teriyaki salmon or chicken."

This spicy chicken and mushroom udon is so utterly delicious and full of flavor. You’re going to love having this big bowl of chicken udon for dinner!

If you don’t have time to make your own stock, simply buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it and combine it with 6 cups chicken stock and continue the recipe after the stock!

## Grade

Serves: 4

Cost: $

Skill Level: Intermediate

Time to Make: About 3 hours (2 hours 25 minutes inactive)\*

*\*Note: Time will be significantly reduced if using a rotisserie chicken*

## Ingredients for Spicy Chicken and Mushroom Udon

**Chicken Stock:**

1 large chicken, giblets discarded

6 cups water

4 bay leaves

Salt and pepper

**Udon:**

16 ounces fresh or frozen udon noodles

2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided

2 tablespoons soy sauce

2 tablespoons mirin

1 tablespoon chili oil

12 ounces shiitake mushroom caps, sliced

1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar

4 eggs

**For Serving:**

Sesame oil, optional

Chili oil, optional

Sesame seeds

## Method

## Prepare the Stock:

* Combine the chicken, water, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in a large stock pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours until the meat is almost falling off the bone and the stock has reduced a bit.
* Remove the chicken and meat from the pot and transfer to a bowl.
* Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve and discard any solids. Set the stock aside.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Discard the skin and bones.
* Carefully wipe out the stock pot and return it to the stove.

## Prepare the Udon Broth:

* Return the chicken stock to the pot and add 1 tablespoon sesame oil, the soy sauce, the chili oil, and the mirin. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium.
* Add the shredded chicken and the sliced shiitake mushrooms and cook for 25 minutes to allow the mushrooms to soften. Taste and season to your preferences.

## Cook the Udon Noodles:

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the udon noodles according to package instructions. Using a spider strainer or tongs, carefully scoop out the noodles and transfer to a colander, leaving the water in the pot.
* Rinse the udon noodles with cold water and toss with the remaining tablespoon of sesame oil.

## Prepare the Poached Eggs:

1. Keep the udon cooking water over medium heat and add the distilled white vinegar.
2. Carefully strain off any excess egg whites from the eggs (either through a sieve or by cracking the eggs into individual ramekins and holding a fork up to the lip of the ramekin and tipping it forward into the sink to strain the excess whites through the fork).
3. Using the back of a wooden spoon, create a whirlpool in the pot of water (at the 12:00 position) and carefully drop the egg in. Move on to the 3:00 position and create another whirlpool and drop the next egg in. Do this for 6:00 and 9:00. Keep the water at a steady simmer and watch the eggs. It will take anywhere between 4 and 6 minutes for the eggs to poach. 
4. Using a fork, transfer the eggs to a plate and season with salt and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.

## To Serve:

1. Divide the cooked udon noodles between bowls and ladle the chicken and mushroom broth on top. Place a poached egg on top of each dish and garnish with more sesame oil, chili oil, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!"

**Ingredients**

  
Chocolate Cake

  
2 tsp instant espresso powder\*  
1 cup water hot  
2 cups flour all-purpose  
2 cups granulated sugar  
3/4 cups cocoa powder  
2 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp salt  
1 cup buttermilk  
1/2 cup vegetable oil  
2 large eggs

Chocolate Buttercream

  
1 1/2 cups butter unsalted, room temperature  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
4 1/2 cups icing sugar  
3/4 cup cocoa powder  
3-5 tbsp milk

  
Chocolate Ganache

  
1 cup chocolate chips  
1 cup whipping cream  
US Customary – Metric

  
**Instructions**

  
Chocolate Cake

  
Preheat the oven to 350F. Prepare two 8 or 9"" round cake pans by spraying them lightly with cooking spray, and lining them with parchment paper.  
Sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.

  
Whisk the instant espresso powder and hot water in a large mixing bowl, then add the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Mix until well combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until you no longer see flour.

  
Disperse the batter evenly between the two cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Let the cakes cool completely to room temperature.

  
Chocolate Buttercream

  
Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, whip the butter and vanilla until light and fluffy. Sift the powdered sugar and cocoa to the bowl and, starting on LOW speed, beat until just combined.  
Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the cocoa and sugar are well combined. Add the milk, 1 tbsp at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.  
Chocolate Ganache

  
Add the chocolate chips to a small bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it just bubbles around the edges. Remove from the heat and pour over the chips. Let it stand for 1 minute, then whisk until smooth.  
  
**How to assemble your cake like mine**

   
Let the cake cool down FULLY! This is so important. It will melt the buttercream otherwise. You can even let the cake cool fully in the fridge to be safe. Once it has reached room temperature, cover it with plastic so that it doesn’t dry out if you aren’t going to decorate right away.

  
Remove the cakes from their pans and peel the parchment paper from the bottoms of the cake. Use a bread or cake knife to slice the dome off the cakes. Work slowly to make sure the cake stays level.

  
You can keep this cake in two layers, or four like mine. No matter how many layers you end up with, make sure to layer it as such: Place a round of cake with the smooth, bottom side DOWN and the sliced side UP. Smooth a level layer of buttercream over the cake.

  
If you’re making two layers, the top layer should be flipped upside down to the smooth, uncut side is facing UP. To make 4 layers, layer the inner pieces of cake with buttercream and finish with the bottom, smooth round facing UP. This will ensure your cake is perfectly smooth and level.

  
Cover the entire cake with a layer of buttercream. Use a cake spatula or even a butter knife to smooth the buttercream as you see fit.

&#x200B;

  
If the ganache has hardened a bit, you can microwave it for 10-second intervals, stirring in between, until it is warm, not hot. Pour the ganache over the top of the cake and carefully to the edges just until you get a few drips. Work around the edge of the cake until you are happy with the drips.

  
Optional: I had some extra buttercream so I added it to a piping bag and added some decoration on top with chocolate chips."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nrekf5,https://i.redd.it/g1vcucj872371.jpg,reddit,"Xiao long bao are also known as ""soup dumplings"" in English speaking countries as they are essentially small buns filled with meat and hot soup. As the name implies, they are extremely juicy, savory, and quite special.

&#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/FUb_t3bzPEw)

&#x200B;

**Why is it fool-proof?**

I found that the most challenging part of making xiao long bao is how to make the skin super thin, like almost translucent. An easy solution is to use a pasta maker! In addition, traditionally, the soup inside xiao long bao is created by wrapping solid meat jelly usually made from pig skin, and the heat from steaming will melt the meat jelly into soup. However, this recipe is meant to be super easy and also tasty, so here I am using chicken broth. Add the chicken broth (120ml) into the meat filling (150g), keep stirring until all the chicken broth is absorbed.

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

\- 115g all-purpose flour

\- 1 tbsp (15ml) oil

\- 2oz (60ml) water

Filling:

\- 150g 70-80% lean ground pork

\- 1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine

\- 1 tbsp soy sauce

\- 1 tsp (5ml) sesame oil

\- 1g salt

\- 1g sugar

\- 1g black pepper

\- 3g ginger (finely chopped)

\- 1 scallion (finely chopped, optional)

\- 4-5oz (120-150ml) chicken broth

&#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. **Dough:** Mix the flour, salt, oil, and water together to form a soft dough and let it rest for at least one hour to form the gluten strands.
2. **Filling:** Add all the spices as listed above into the meat filling. Add the chicken broth, keep stirring until all the chicken broth is absorbed. Put them in the refrigerator for later use.
3. **How to make translucent wrappers:** Divide the dough into 3 pieces, run them through a pasta maker, adjust the knob until it is at number 7. The dough will become paper thin, use a cup or a cutter (4.5 inches in diameter) to make round wrappers. Make sure to flour them to prevent sticking. The amount of ingredients I used here can make 18 wrappers.
4. **How to wrap the soup dumpling:** Place one tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper, pick up one spot, fold and pinch, fold and pinch, keep repeating this step to make one soup dumpling (xiao long bao).
5. **Cooking:** Bring the water to a rolling boil, steam the soup dumplings for about 10 minutes using medium to high heat.
6. **How to eat the soup dumpling:** Take a tiny bite out of the skin, slurp the soup out of the xiao long bao, dip it into the black vinegar gently and finish the whole thing off in one bite!

**Notes:**

1. In the dough recipe, the oil will make the xiao long bao skin tender and smooth.
2. Because xiao long bao is filled with only meat, dipping them into black vinegar will make you feel less fatty.
3. I also prefer the chicken stock than the traditional pig skin soup, the pig skin soup will be greasier and fattier than this."

**Ingredients:**

* 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter
* 3/4 cup Light Brown Sugar
* 1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 tbsp Heavy Cream or your milk of choice! (ideally with a high fat content)
* 1 Egg large
* 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1 1/4 cup All-purpose Flour
* 1 tsp Baking Soda
* 1/2 tsp Salt + extra pinch for tops of finished cookies!
* 1 cup Mixture of Semi-sweet and Milk Chocolate roughly chopped

**Instructions:**

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
2. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt butter. Swirl pan every 30 seconds until butter begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to low. Continue swirling for \~3 minutes or until melted butter becomes foamy, makes popping sounds, and begins to take on a nutty aroma! Mixture will begin to turn golden brown and have brown flakes interspersed. Using a wooden spoon or spatula stir butter, lift browned butter bits from the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In the meantime, move onto step 3.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. (This process aerates and sifts dry ingredients!) Set aside.
4. Using a large bowl with an electric mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat sugars (brown and granulated) with melted brown butter and heavy cream for 1 min. Add in egg and vanilla extract. Stir until combined and scrape sides of bowl once more to incorporate all the batter.
5. Slowly add flour mixture to the wet butter/sugar/egg mixture, beating on low speed until just combined. Add roughly chopped chocolate pieces to the batter. Stir until combined.
6. Scoop dough into 2 tbsp portions and set on flat plate/baking sheet.
7. Refrigerate dough for at least 1h (this step allows all of the beautiful cookie flavours to combine and form a perfectly spread cookie!)
8. Preheat oven to 350F (325F if using convection bake).
9. Once dough is chilled, remove from fridge and place cookies onto baking sheet, spaced 2"" apart.
10. Bake cookies at 350F for 12-14 min or until the edges are golden brown (mine were perfect after 13 min at 325F convection bake).
11. Sprinkle each cookie with flaked salt upon removing from the oven!

### Ingredients

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 medium onion diced
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 5 oz tomato paste 1 can
* 24 oz tomato sauce 1 can
* 28 oz crushed tomatoes 1 can, or diced tomatoes
* 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
* 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* 1/4 tsp pepper or to taste
* 2 cups ricotta cheese
* 3/4 cup parmesan cheese shredded
* 1/4 cup parsley freshly chopped
* 1 egg
* 4 cups mozzarella
* 16-20 lasagna sheets oven-ready

### Instructions

* Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef and onion to the pot. Sauté, breaking the beef into small pieces, until it is completely cooked through. Add the garlic and tomato paste. Cook for 1 minute, stirring to mix the tomato paste into the beef.
* Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and Italian seasoning to the pot, and stir. Bring the sauce to a bubble then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a lid and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper as needed. If the sauce is too thick, stir in a bit of water.
* Mix the ricotta, parsley, 1/4 cup of the parmesan, and a pinch of each salt and pepper in a bowl. Taste the mixture and adjust the seasoning as needed, then mix in the egg.
* Spread about 2 cups of the sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13"" casserole dish. Layer: 4-5 lasagna sheets over the sauce, then spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, top with 2/3 cup mozzarella, then 1 2/3 cups sauce. Repeat those layers, starting with the noodles, twice more. Finish with 4-5 lasagna sheets, the remaining sauce, remaining mozzarella, and remaining 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.
* Cover the casserole dish with foil and bake for 45-55 minutes. Use a knife to stab through the middle of the lasagna to test the doneness of the noodles. Once they are tender, remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes. If you want the top browned even more, turn on the broiler for 1-3 minutes. Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.

Ingredients:

- 8 slices of thick bacon, diced
- 1 garlic glove, smashed and unpeeled 
- 340g Spaghetti 
- 4 eggs
- 200g pecorino romano
- salt 
- fresh ground peppers
- chopped flat leaf parsley

Method:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and drop in your pasta. 

Add bacon, garlic glove and pepper to a cold pan and set to medium heat. Starting from cold will help render out the fat from the bacon. Cook until golden brown. Discard garlic clove. Do not get rid of the fat! Pasta should be al dente by then. 


In the mean time, add two eggs and cheese to a bowl and whisk to combine, set aside.

Crack the two remaining eggs in a buttered pan over medium low heat. Salt. Cook until egg white is fully cooked, or not ;)

Using tongs, grab al dente pasta directly from the pot and add to the bacon. Add about 3/4 cup of pasta water and stir vigorously. The bacon fat and starchy water will emulsified together and create an amazing creamy like texture. Add more water if needed. 

Remove pan from the heat and stir in egg and cheese mixture. Stir until cheese has fully melted and pasta are fully coated with the eggs. Please note that if you add the egg mixture while on the stove the eggs will cook and you’ll end up with scrambled eggs. 

Salt and pepper to taste.

Time to plate. Using tongs roll your pasta and place in your favorite pasta bowls. carefully place your perfectly runny sunny side up egg on top. Add more cheese — obviously — top with parsley And enjoy!

For the Dough:

\- 2 Cups All Purpose Flour

\- 1/2 Cup Hot Water

\- 1/3 Cup Room-Temp Water

For the Lamination Paste:

\- 1/2 Cup All Purpose Flour

\- 1/4 Cup untoasted Sesame Oil

\- 1/4 Cup Neutral Oil

\- 1 tsp Onion Powder

\- 1 tbsp Chinese 5 Spice

\- 2 tsp Salt

\- 1 Cup Spring Onion (Chopped)

For the Sauce:

\- 1 tsp Hoisin Sauce

\- 1 tsp Soy Sauce

\- 2 tsp Chili Oil

Recipe:

\- Combine the ingredients for the dough, and mix well

\- Knead the dough until smooth and sticky. Rest for at least 30 minutes, the longer the better, I kept mine in the fridge for 20 hours.

\- Heat up the Sesame Oil & the Neutral oil, while combining the other ingredients for the lamination paste in a bowl

\- Pour over heated oil over the ingredients, mix well

\- Divide the rested dough into 3

\- Roll out the dough into a very thin layer, and spread the lamination paste

\- Roll into a jelly roll structure and twist inwards from one end, and outwards from the other. Put one end on top of another and squish.

\- Roll out until flat, and fry over low heat with a good amount of oil to cover the whole surface.

\- Flip once golden and crispy

\- Serve with the Sauce and enjoy

Notes:

\- The dough gets better the longer you rest it, I rested mine for 20 hours and the result was great! In a pinch, however, a 30 min rest would do just fine too! I have made both versions before and they are both good!

\- The lamination paste works exactly how it does in a croissant, just in an instant way. It helps to keep the layers separate. I tried just using plain oil and scallions, however the paste really makes a huge difference. Each layers becomes more distinguishable.

-	Finely shredded cabbage, ½ cup
-	Leaf lettuce, 2 – 3 leaves
-	Cooked white rice, 1 cup
-	Potato starch or corn starch for battering
-	Oil for frying

**MARINADE**
-	Minced garlic, 4 cloves
-	Minced ginger, ½ inch piece
-	Soy sauce, 2 tbsp
-	Cooking sake, 1 tbsp

**GREEN ONION SAUCE**
-	Soy sauce, 4 tsp
-	Rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp
-	Mirin, 2 tbsp
-	Sesame oil, 1.5 tsp
-	Salt, .5 tsp
-	Minced green onion white, 1.5 tbsp

**GARNISH**
-	Sliced green onion
-	Japanese 7 spice powder (Shichimi)

# Instructions
1.	Slice the chicken thigh into 7 large chunks (refer to the video for a visual aid) and add into a large mixing bowl.
2.	Add the **MARINADE** ingredients to the chicken and mix well. Allow the meat to marinade for 10 minutes.
3.	In a small pot, bring water to a boil and add 1 room temperature egg. Allow it to boil for 3 minutes, then shock it in ice water. Leave the egg in the ice water and continue working on the rest of the recipe.
4.	Pour out the excess marinade liquid into a separate bowl and set aside.
5.	Beat 1 egg and add it to the meat and mix to combine. 
6.	Add the flour and mix well until no dry flour is visible.
7.	Pour the potato starch into a shallow tray and pour in the reserved marinade liquid. Mix the liquid into the starch and press down on any large lumps to create small nuggets. These will add extra crunch to the batter.
8.	Batter the chicken pieces in the potato starch one by one (refer to the video for a visual aid). Then lay them onto a sheet, making sure that they are not touching each other. Allow them to sit in the open for five minutes for the outside to dry out. This ensures a crunchier crust on the chicken.
9.	Add enough oil for frying to a large pot and heat it to 180 celcius (about 350 F). I highly recommend the use of a kitchen thermometer, as it will ensure that your oil is at the perfect temperature.

*TRIPLE FRY TECHNIQUE*

10. Add the chicken to the oil, piece by piece. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Allow the pieces to sit in the oil, undisturbed for about 15 seconds. Then, gently move them around, making sure that they don’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Allow them to continue frying for another 45 seconds (1 minute in total), gently agitating them in the oil.

11. Remove the pieces from the oil onto a draining pan and allow them to rest for 30 seconds.

12. Add the partially cooked chicken back into the oil and fry them for 1 minute.

13. Remove the pieces from the oil again for another 30 seconds.

14. Add the partially cooked chicken back into the oil for one final minute. Remove from the oil and drain well. Continue cooking the rest of the chicken using this triple fry technique.

15. Create the green onion sauce by adding all of the **GREEN ONION SAUCE** ingredients to a bowl and mixing well. Allow it to sit for 5 minutes for the green onion pungency  to mellow.

16. Add rice to a bowl and top with 1/3 of the green onion sauce. Tear the lettuce leaf into pieces and arrange them decoratively around the edge of the bowl. Add the shredded cabbage to the center of the bowl in a mound.

17. Lay the fried chicken around the bowl, leaving a hole in the center.

18. Crack the chilled soft-boiled egg onto a small dish and carefully slide it onto the center of the bowl.

19. Pour the rest of the green onion sauce onto the chicken, garnish with sliced green onions, and Japanese 7-spice powder."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ektyy7,https://i.redd.it/d8a1c9vyq5941.jpg,reddit,"This sandwich was inspired by Daniel Uditi, the chef over at Pizzana. My spin on the classic meatball sub was to swap out the beef with freshly ground venison from this year’s harvest. Since the venison is so lean I cut the blend with 50% ground pork to add some fat back into the equation. The meatballs were packed into homemade sesame rolls and finished off in a wood fired oven. [I made a short video going through the entire process here with a link to the full recipe with photos.](https://youtu.be/pyO9hf6ldGo) 

**The Meatballs**

1 pound ground venison (or substitute with beef)

1 pound ground pork

2 cloves of garlic (finely minced)

¼ cup chopped parsley

1 cup of torn stale bread pieces, soaked in buttermilk\*

¾ cup grated parmesan

Dried chili flakes (to your liking)

1 Egg

Salt and Pepper

Buttermilk

\*I like to use any stale homemade sourdough bread I have laying around, but store bought works just as well. I like larger torn pieces as they give the meatball some airiness that you won’t get with the store-bought breadcrumbs. But if the pieces are too big, the meatball might begin to fall apart. 

I brown my meatballs in a wood fired oven to give it a little smokey flavor but this can easily be done in a cast iron skillet. Brown all sides of each meatball and set aside as they cook. Once all the meatballs are browned, transfer them over to your simmering pot of red sauce and continue simmering (on low) for another 30 - 45 minutes until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. 

**The Red Sauce**

This is my Nonna’s classic red sauce that I rarely deviate from. 

Stewed whole San Marzano tomatoes

Garlic

Yellow onion

Basil

Parmesan Rind

Salt

Pepper

Extra virgin olive oil

The key here is simplicity, and *good ingredients (especially the tomatoes)*. Lightly puree the tomatoes in a processor or with a stick blender. Be careful not to aerate the tomatoes too much. For a chunkier sauce you can simply crush the tomatoes by hand. Set aside in a bowl. Peel and dice three to five cloves of garlic and set aside. Peel and chop the onion in half. By cooking the entire halves you will impart the flavor of the onion and the sauce won’t have chunks of onion in it. 

Heat a generous pour of EVOO in your saucepan at medium to low heat. Add your garlic and onion halves and let simmer for a few minutes. Be careful not to burn anything. Add a piece of parmesan rind into the hot oil, and let it simmer for another minute. The oils from the cheese will add depth to the sauce. Add your tomatoes to the pan, and bring to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste. My Nonna would often use a pinch of white granulated sugar just to add a little more sweetness but if you’re using good quality tomatoes this step is not necessary. Add some chopped basil, stir, and set on medium/low. You want your sauce to simmer for about 30 - 45 minutes. Stir frequently to make sure it's not sticking to the bottom.

**Finishing Touches**

I serve the meatballs (and sauce) on homemade sesame rolls that I’ve been iterating on this for the past year. [That recipe can be found here](https://www.saucesandwich.com/blog/sourdough-sesame-rolls). Slice each roll and open up like a book and set into a skillet or pan. Fill the entire surface with meatballs and ladle on a generous helping of sauce. Top with good quality buffalo mozzarella. Put the entire skillet back into the wood fire (or in your oven) until the cheese is completely melted. Remove from the heat, garnish with some fresh basil and your sandwich is ready to go.

CAKE INGREDIENTS: 

1. 3 cups (375 g) flour
2. 1 teaspoon (5 ml) baking powder
3. 1 teaspoon (5 ml) kosher salt or sea salt
4. 1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter , (2 sticks) softened
5. 2.5 cups (500 g) sugar
6. 1/2 cup (120 ml) canola oil (or vegetable oil) 
7. zest from 3-4 large lemons
8. 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice
9. 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vanilla extract
10. 5 eggs

LEMON GLAZE INGREDIENTS:

1. 1/3 cup (80 ml) fresh lemon juice
2. 1/2 cup (100 g) sugar

LEMON ICING INGREDIENTS: 

1. 1 cup (120 g) powdered sugar
2. 1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice 

INSTRUCTIONS 

MAKE LEMON CAKE:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a bowl, whisk or sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Set aside.
3. In an another bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes if by stand mixer.
4. Beat in the oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. On the lowest speed, gradually beat in the eggs until just incorporated. Mix in the flour mixture, until just combined.
5. Coat a 12-cup bundt pan or two 6-cup bundt pans with cooking spray.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan.
7. Firmly tap the pan against the countertop to knock out any bubbles.
8. Bake on the middle oven rack for 50-70 minutes for a 12-cup bundt pan (45-65 minutes for two 6-cup bundt pans), or until a toothpick comes out clean near the center. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then loosen the cake by tapping it against the counter. Invert the cake onto a serving platter.

MAKE THE LEMON GLAZE:

1. Stir together lemon glaze ingredients (lemon juice & sugar - if needed, heat them briefly to help dissolve the sugar). Brush on the hot cake until all of the glaze is absorbed (you may not end up using all of the glaze).

MAKE LEMON ICING & SERVE:


1. whisk together the icing ingredients (powdered sugar & lemon juice), adjusting the lemon juice amount to make the icing fairly thick but pourable, however not too runny. If the icing is close to the thickness you want, but still a touch too thick to pour, warm it slightly and it will become more fluid when it cools off (perfect for icing the bundt cake). Drizzle the icing over the top of the bundt cake and serve when the icing sets."

# Ingredients

* 8 Corn Tortillas
* 5 tbsp Canola Oil divided
* 2 1/4 cups Chicken Stock
* 5 Guajillo Chiles stemmed, seeded
* 2 Garlic Cloves minced
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1/2 tsp Dried Oregano
* 1/4 tsp Black Pepper
* 4 Skinless Boneless Chicken Thighs
* 2 Yukon Gold Potatoes chopped
* 3 Carrots chopped
* 1 Spanish Onion chopped
* 1 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
* 12 oz Queso Fresco or Feta Cheese crumbled

# Instructions

1. Brush both sides of the tortillas with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, sear the tortillas until they’re lightly browned and starting to crisp, for about 1 minute per side. Set the tortillas aside until you're ready to assemble the dish.
2. In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth, chiles guajillos, garlic, salt, oregano, and pepper to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover, and let sit until the chiles are soft, for 30 minutes. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth.
3. In a large heavy pot over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Cook the chicken thighs until deep golden brown, for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn the pieces over and brown the other side, for 5 to 6 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a plate. If there isn’t at least 1 tablespoon of fat in the pot, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil along with the potatoes, carrots, and onion. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned, for 4 to 6 minutes.
4. Pour the chile puree into the pot with the vegetables; scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Nestle the chicken into the sauce and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the chicken is completely tender and cooked through, for about 30 minutes.
5. Stir the vinegar into the pot and mound the chicken and vegetables on one side so there’s room on the other side to dip the tortillas into the sauce.
6. Using tongs and working with one tortilla at a time, dip into the chile sauce, turning to coat, and cook in the sauce until softened, for about 3 seconds per side. Transfer the tortillas to a baking sheet as you go. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the queso fresco across the center of each tortilla and fold over like a taco.
7. Divide the enchiladas among four plates and spoon more chile sauce over top. Top with lettuce, pickled onion, sour cream, cilantro and any remaining queso. Serve with the chicken, vegetables, remaining sauce, and pickled jalapeños."

* caramel sauce\*\* to serve

### Instructions

* Prep a 9×9 baking dish by spreading the butter evenly over the bottom and sides. Preheat the oven to 375F.
* Mash 3 of the bananas in a large mixing bowl with the cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and salt. Whisk in the brown sugar and eggs until well combined, then stir in the milk.
* Add the bread cubes to a separate large mixing bowl, and pour the prepared milk mixture over top. Use a spatula to fold the mixture to combine everything evenly. Let the bread soak for 2-3 minutes, then pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
* Spread the bread cubes evenly, corner to corner, in the baking dish. Slice the remaining banana and arrange over the top. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until the bread pudding is golden brown and fully set. Serve with whipped cream and caramel sauce.

### Notes

\*It’s important that the bread cubes are completely dry, or “stale”, so the bread pudding doesn’t come out mushy. To stale your bread, you have two options:

1. Cube the bread and leave it in a single layer on a large baking sheet overnight.
2. Cube the bread and bake at 250F for 30-35 minutes, until dry.

\*\*Easy homemade caramel sauce:

1. Melt 6 tbsp unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 cup of brown sugar to the pan and whisk well to combine.
2. Bring the mixture to a bubble and whisk often for about 5 minutes, until the brown sugar has mostly dissolved.
3. Turn the heat down to low and add 1/2 cup heavy cream. Continue to whisk until the mixture is completely smooth.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 2 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 – 1/2 tsp salt, depending on your preference. Pour the sauce into a heat-proof jar or container and let it cool down at room temperature for 15-20 minutes before serving."

It’s summer and heat outside, and you want some cold, but at the same time hearty dish.

Now I want to present you a recipe based on the recipes of Korean cuisine. As usual with my cooking options.

By the way, this dish can be served hot, or you can simply put all the ingredients on a plate and lightly sprinkle with broth. In general, as you like. Let’s start. [(The original recipe and many other recipes)](https://grillmangal.art/en/cold-noodle-dish-in-korean-style/)

**Ingredients (for 6 servings)**

* Chicken breast – 700 g
* Noodles (wheat) – 350 g
* Water – 1.5 l
* Tomatoes – 1 pc (230 g)
* Cucumbers – 2 pcs (380 g)
* Garlic – 5 cloves
* Soy sauce – 5 tablespoons
* Red ground pepper – 1 tsp
* Vinegar 9% – 5 tsp
* Salt – 2.5 tsp (17 g)
* Sugar – 2.5 tbsp. (50 g)
* Eggs – 4 pcs (60-65 g each)
* Sunflower oil – 3 tbsp.

**Let’s start cooking**

1. First, let’s take a look at the chicken breast. We will remove the excess – films, fat. And cut into small strips. It can also be in pieces, the main thing is that it is not thicker than 1 cm, and then it is convenient to eat.
2. Place the chopped chicken in a container, pour in a tablespoon of soy sauce and a tablespoon of sunflower oil, mix, cover with a film and let it stand warm for about 30 minutes, while we will deal with other ingredients.
3. Cut the cucumbers into strips, put them in another container, add a pinch of salt, mix and also leave warm.
4. It’s time to start the broth. Pour cold boiled water (1.5 l) into the pan, add sugar (2.5 tbsp), salt (2.5 tsp), 5 teaspoons of vinegar, soy sauce (4 tbsp), set saucepan over low heat and heat slightly, stirring occasionally. Do not bring to a boil. Once the salt and sugar have dissolved, remove the pan from the heat. Let cool to room temperature.
5. Crush 3 cloves of garlic and add to the broth
6. Cut the tomato into cubes and also add to the broth
7. The broth is ready. Someone prefers to cool it in the refrigerator, I am not a supporter of too cold broth, room temperature is enough.
8. Drain the excess liquid from the cucumbers, and let them stand further.
9. Heat the pan, add 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and put the chicken breast here. Fry for no more than 2-3 minutes and add here 1 teaspoon of red ground pepper and 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic. Cook for a couple more minutes and turn off. Put the breast in a separate container, and pour the cucumbers with the resulting sauce in the pan.
10. Make 2 omelettes (two eggs each). Put them on a plate and let them cool. Once cool, cut them into small strips. (I usually roll it into a tube and then cut it, it’s convenient)
11. Well, the noodles remained. Someone makes it at the very beginning, but this is not important – thin noodles cool down instantly. We cook the noodles as stated on the package (mine is cooked for 3-4 minutes).
12. Here are all the ingredients we have prepared. It remains only to connect them.
13. You can serve all the ingredients on one large dish, and everyone takes what they want and pours as much broth as they like. Some people eat it like a paste – putting all the ingredients on a flat plate and lightly pouring the broth.
14. Order of serving. We put the noodles in a cup, put the chicken on top, next to the tomatoes, omelette strips and cucumbers. Pour in broth, quantity as desired.

That’s all!

Enjoy your meal!

Cook with pleasure!"

**The Cannoli Cream**

Traditional   cannoli cream uses a sheep’s milk ricotta which I prefer - if I can  get  my hands on it. Any other high fat unpasteurized milk will work. Or  if  you want to cut some corners or are tight on time you can start off  with  any decent premade ricotta. Skip the low fat stuff, you’re making   cannoli.

3 cups of drained ricotta (I will be posting a recipe for this soon)

1.3 cups of confectioner’s sugar

1.5 tsp vanilla

Orange Zest

Using   a hand or stand mixer, whip together these ingredients for a few   minutes until well incorporated. Transfer from a bowl to a piping bag   and keep in the refrigerator until ready to use.

**The Shells**

This   is part that can easily go wrong and where you need to have a zen   mindset. This recipe makes about 45 small to medium sized shells.

1.5 cups of all purpose Flour

.5 tsp cinnamon powder

1.5 tsp cocoa powder

2 tbsp white sugar

.5 tsp salt

3 tbsp cubed and chilled butter

2 tbsp Marsala

.5 tsp white vinegar

.25 cup of water

1 egg (for the wash)

1. Heat a neutral, high heat oil to 350F in a deep pot or fryer.
2. In   stand mixer, combine all of the dry ingredients and mix well. Add in   wet ingredients (except the egg) and continue to blend for a few   minutes. Mixture will be somewhat crumbly. Remove from the bowl and pour   out onto a large working surface.
3. Knead   with your hands for 5 - 10 minutes until you have a mostly smooth and   homogenous ball of dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room   temperature for 1 hour.
4. Remove   the dough from the plastic and cut into about 5 smaller pieces. Flour   the dough balls gently. Pass each ball through the pasta maker, going   from the widest setting down about 6 settings. Be slow and methodical,   and don’t skip any steps.
5. Lay   each sheet of dough out on your work surface and gently flour again.   Using your circular punch out form, cut circles and save all of the   excess dough which you’ll use for one final pass through the pasta   maker.
6. Carefully   and tightly wrap/roll each cut circle around the cannoli tube, and  seal  the edge with your egg wash. Be extremely careful not to let egg  get  all over the place. Avoid getting the egg on the cannoli tube or  the  dough will end up sticking to the tube while frying. Clean up any  egg  that gets on your work surface.
7. When   the oil temperature has reached 350F, drop each tube into the oil and   fry until golden. Using tongs, turn the cannoli in the oil so they cook   evenly. This should take only about 1 minute.
8. Transfer   to a rack lined with paper towels and carefully slide the shells off  of  the tubes while it’s still hot. You’ll want to use more paper towels  so  you don’t burn your fingers.
9. The   tubes should be wiped down, and chilled in the refrigerator for just 1  -  2 minutes before starting the next round of shells. This avoids a  lot  of mess ups.

**The finishing touches**

Once   the shells have completely cooled you can start filling the cannoli.   This is made easier as a two person task and makes for a fun family   activity, but is manageable by one person if necessary. Using the piping   bag, fill each shell starting with the center and working outwards.   Nothing worse than a cannoli with a big empty pocket of air in the   middle. Once completely filled, you can garnish with whatever you like.   Traditional toppings include candied fruit, crushed pistachio, or   chocolate chips. When the cannoli are all dressed up and ready to go,   you can give them all a final dusting of confectioner’s sugar. They   should be eaten fresh as they start to lose their textural appeal if   they sit around too long and get soggy.

**INGREDIENTS:**

* 3 pounds boneless beef chuck (well-marbled) cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 2 medium yellow onions cut into 1-inch chunks
* 7 cloves garlic peeled and smashed
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 1/2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 cups dry red wine
* 2 cups beef broth
* 2 cups water
* 1 Bay leaf
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 1 1/2 tsp sugar
* 4 large carrots peeled and cut into one-inch chunks on a diagonal
* 1 pound small white boiling potatoes (baby yukons) cut in half Fresh chopped parsley, for serving (optional)

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.
2. Pat the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. (To sear the meat properly, do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a nice brown crust before turning with tongs.) Transfer the meat to a large plate and set aside.
3. Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the brown bits from bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more. Add the beef with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with the flour. Stir with wooden spoon until the flour is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours.
4. Remove the pot from the oven and add the carrots and potatoes. Cover and place back in oven for about an hour more, or until the vegetables are cooked, the broth is thickened, and the meat is tender. Fish out the bay leaf and discard, then taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve the stew warm -- or let it come to room temperature and then store in the refrigerator overnight or until ready to serve. This stew improves in flavor if made at least 1 day ahead. Reheat, covered, over medium heat or in a 350°F oven. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.
5. Freezer-Friendly Instructions: The stew can be frozen for up to 3 months. Just omit the potatoes because they don’t freeze well. If you’d like, boil some potatoes separately when you defrost the stew and either add them into the stew or serve them on the side. Before serving, defrost the stew in the refrigerator for 24 hours and then reheat on the stovetop over medium-low heat until hot.

* 3/4 cup Pine Nuts
* 3/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* 1 Garlic Clove
* 1 pinch Kosher Salt
* 1 cup Parmigiano Reggiano grated

# Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
2. Combine pine nuts, olive oil, garlic and salt in food processor and process until mixture is very smooth and creamy.
3. Tear and place basil in food processor and process until just evenly combined and mixture is light green, about 5 pulses. Add cheese and pulse until just combined, about 5 pulses more.
4. One by one, add the pasta squares to the boiling water and cook until just al dente, about 3 minutes.
5. Meanwhile reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water.
6. Place 1 cup of the pesto in a large nonstick skillet. When the pasta squares are cooked remove them from the water using a slotted spoon then gently add them to the sauce.
7. Stir gently to coat. Each sheet should be coated in the pesto and there should be enough sauce in the pan to just coat the bottom. If the mixture is dry, add a few spoonfuls of the reserved pasta cooking water. 
8. Top with additional cheese and serve immediately.
9. NOTE: Makes 2 cups pesto enough for 2 to 3 pounds of pasta."

Great tasting lasagna is easy to make if you're willing to spend a little time getting it right. This is my wife's favourite lasagna recipe and hopefully you'll like it too.

If you're interested, you can watch the [instructional video here](https://youtu.be/DepqRI3tKI0)

&#x200B;

**Ingredients**

For the ragu:

* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 onion (finely chopped)
* 1 carrot (finely chopped)
* 1 stick of celery (finely chopped)
* 750g beef mince
* 130g pancetta (cut into small cubes)
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 beef stock cube / pot (dissolved in a little hot water)
* 1 sprig of rosemary (leaves picked and finely chopped)
* 1 glass white wine
* 1 can chopped tomatoes
* 2 tbsp tomato puree / paste

For the Béchamel

* 1L full fat milk
* 1 bay leaf
* 75g butter
* 125g flour
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 Nutmeg grated (to taste)
* 2 egg yolks
* 100g parmesan cheese

For the layers

* 12 lasagna sheets (softened for 20 seconds in hot water)
* 50g parmesan

&#x200B;

**Instructions**

For the ragu:

1. Heat the oil in a large pan and then add the vegetables and leave to fry for 5 minutes until softened and beginning to colour.
2. Add the mince and pancetta and fry for a minute or two then add the garlic, stock and rosemary and cook until the meat has browned on all sides.
3. Add the white wine and simmer until slightly reduced before adding the tomatoes and tomato puree.
4. Leave to simmer either on a low heat on the hob or in a preheated over at 160C for at least 1.5-2 hours.

For the béchamel:

1. heat the milk and bay leaf until it begins to simmer and then remove from the heat and set aside.
2. In a separate pan, melt the butter over a medium heat and then add the flour to make a roux then add the milk (slowly at first) whilst stirring constantly.
3. When you've added all of the milk, continue to stir over heat for about 15 minutes until the sauce becomes really thick.
4. Remove the bay leaf, season with black pepper and grate in the nutmeg to taste - I like to give it a really good grating.
5. Mix in the egg yolks, then parmesan and remove from the heat and allow to cool.

For the layers

1. Grease a square baking dish (mine was 26x26cm) and add two sheets of lasagna.
2. Cover the lasagna with a layer of ragu and then cover that with a layer of béchamel.
3. Repeat the process until you're out of ragu. If you've got the thicknesses right then you should have enough for 4 decent layers.
4. Top with a final layer of pasta, béchamel and then sprinkle over the remaining cheese.
5. Bake in a fan oven at 160C for 45-55 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and golden brown 

&#x200B;

**Tips**

* You might want to turn the temperature up to 200C if its not cooked in 55 minutes to get the golden brown top but keep an eye on it because it will turn quickly. Don't turn the temperature up before then of the top will burn before the middle is cooked.
* The longer you leave the ragu to simmer the better it will taste. Aim for 3 hours if you have time.
* You can make any stage of the lasagna a day in advance, or make the lasagna and refrigerate overnight before cooking - the flavours will only develop more the longer you leave it.
* Tastes great reheated or even cold as leftovers too.

* 1 Tbsp butter, unsalted
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 Tbsp flour
* Few slivers of habanero
* Few cilantro leaves
* Salt & pepper

### Instructions

* Take scallops out of the fridge 20-30 minutes before cooking.  Rinse under cold water and then dry completely with a paper towel.
* Mix salt and pepper with a little bit of flour, then quickly roll the scallops in this mixture...shake off the excess, you just want a light dusting. 
* Heat butter and olive oil over medium-high to high in a non-stick frying pan.
* Once the pan gets hot, add the scallops.   You should hear a nice sizzle when they touch the pan’s surface.  Make sure they’re not touching each other in the pan & don’t move them while sizzling.
* Let them develop a nice, brown crust (the inside will stay tender and creamy), which should take about 1-½ to 2 minutes. Then you can turn them and cook for another minute. Do not overcook them!  
* Plate your scallops on a pre-heated dish, drizzle some of the pan juices over them, add a few cilantro leaves (if you have some handy; I also like chives), and add a few slivers of habanero for a little kick...it’s like adding wasabi to your sashimi.  "

&#x200B;

* 3 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
* 1 pound hot Italian sausage, loose
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into half-moons
* Pinch of sugar
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 4 cloves confit garlic (or use 4 cloves minced garlic)
* 1 teaspoon Piment d'Espelette or smoked paprika
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 3 cups water or vegetable stock
* 1 parmesan rind
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 lemon, juiced
* 16 ounces orecchiette
* 1 bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed and roughly chopped
* 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Fresh minced parsley, grated parmesan, and extra virgin olive oil, for garnish

**Brown the sausage:**

1. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks for 12–15 minutes or until completely cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

**Cook the onion:**

1. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil in the same pot and turn the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15–20 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent the onion from burning. Once the onion begins to deepen in color, add a pinch of sugar and continue cooking until completely soft and golden brown, 5–10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Melt the butter into the onion. Add the confit garlic, piment d’Espelette, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute, mashing the garlic into the onion as it cooks. Return the cooked sausage to the pot.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Add the parmesan rind and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until the sauce reduces and begins to thicken. Adjust heat as needed if the sauce reduces too quickly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Discard the parmesan rind.
2. Pour in the heavy cream and turn the heat to medium. Let the cream bubble and thicken for 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and season once more with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low.

**Cook the pasta and broccoli rabe:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a generous amount of salt. About 10 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, add the orecchiette to the water. 2 minutes before the orecchiette finishes cooking, add the broccoli rabe to the pot of boiling water. After 2 minutes, drain the pasta and broccoli rabe.

**Finish the pasta:**

1. Add the cooked pasta, broccoli rabe, and grated parmesan cheese to the sauce; toss to coat. Taste and season once more.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the cooked pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with minced parsley, more parmesan, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like. Enjoy!"

* Slice 1 lb crate of strawberries, makes 2-2 1/2 cups

* Place in medium bowl with up to 1/4 cup sugar 

* Mix gently until evenly coated

* Cover tightly with plastic wrap

* Place in fridge for 2-12 hours, the longer the better, might have to be started the night before making the cake.

COOL WHIP FROSTING:

* 8 oz tub of cool whip 

* 3.4 oz box of pudding mix of choice (vanilla works best)

* 1 cup milk of choice

* 3/4 cup powdered sugar

* Whisk all together in large mixing bowl until blended.

* Store covered in fridge until use, has the possibility of melting in room temperature or hotter situations. Will be light, airy, and super soft unlike most frostings.

CAKE:

* Box cake mix of your choice (white/vanilla or angle food works best), follow box instructions. I normally make two 9"" rounds, most boxes say 350F for 28-33 mins, but I find 25 mins is perfect.

* Once cake is cooled to room temperature place in freezer for up to 30 minutes or fridge for up to 2 hours until completely cold. If cake is domed or lumpy, you may cut off excess to make flat or leave as is.

* Frost bottom layer with desired amount.

* Layer with as many strawberries as you want.

* Place next cake layer.

* Frost sides and top with as much frosting as you want, most likely will have left over.

* Layer top with remaining strawberries.

* Optional: drizzle or ring middle layer, top layer, and/or both with chocolate sauce, whether home made or store bought, just make sure it is no warmer than room temp. 

* Place in freezer for up to 30 minutes or fridge for up to 2 hours until frosting is firm.

* Store in fridge otherwise cool whip frosting could start to melt."

### Ingredients

#### filling

* 6 large plums mine weighed 2.2 pounds or 966 grams
* 1/4 cup or 60 grams sugar
* seeds of one vanilla bean or 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 Tbsp Instant Clearjel or 2 Tbsp cornstarch

#### crumble

* 1/2 cup or 63 grams flour
* 1/2 cup or 54 grams oat flour you can also use rolled oats, or grind rolled oats in your food processor or high speed blender to make oat flour
* 1/2 cup or 79 grams lightly packed brown sugar
* 4 Tbsp or room temperature butter
* 1 tsp almond extract

### Instructions

* Preheat oven to 350F

* Whisk  the flours and sugar together and then add the butter, breaking it up  into smaller pieces, along with the extract. Use your clean hands to  combine the mixture thoroughly into a crumbly texture.
* Put  the fruit into a baking dish (any dish that will fit your fruit snugly  is fine, mine is a 71/2 x 91/2 oval) and top with the crumble.
* Put  the dish onto a baking sheet to catch any drips, and bake for 55-60  minutes, or until the top is golden and the juices are really bubbling. I  sometimes top the crumble loosely with a sheet of foil toward the end  of baking to prevent it browning too much.
* Serve warm, or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream. Store any leftovers on the counter covered with foil."

More detailed instructions at the link above.

## Ingredients

## Pretzels

* 1/2 c warm water
* 2 Tbsp brown sugar
* 1 package Active Dry yeast
* 6 Tbsp salted butter melted
* 4 c flour
* 1-1/2 tsp salt
* 2/3 c baking soda
* 1 c beer
* coarse salt

## Spinach Artichoke Dip

* 2 strips bacon crumbled
* 1 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 Tbsp salted butter melted
* 4 oz cream cheese
* 1 clove garlic minced
* 1/2 c mozzarella
* 1/2 c Parmesan
* 1/2 c spinach cooked
* 6.7 oz jar artichoke hearts
* 1/2 c sour cream
* 1/4 c mayonnaise

## Instructions

* Combine warm water, brown sugar, and yeast in a bowl, mix, and let sit for 5 minutes.
* To your brown sugar-water-yeast mixture, now add the butter, flour, salt, and beer, and mix in a stand mixer with a dough hook until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Form the dough into a ball and place in an oiled bowl. Roll the dough around in the bowl until all sides of the dough are oiled. Cover with a towel and let sit in a warm place for 1 hour, until dough has doubled in size.
* In the meantime, mix together the spinach artichoke dip. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix. Really, that’s it!
* Once the dough has doubled in size, cut it into 8 equal-sized pieces. Roll out each piece into a rope and roll it out flat with a rolling pin until they measure about 3” x 12”. Place the spinach artichoke dip along the center of each, for the entire length (except for about 1 inch on each end).  
* Roll up the dough to surround the dip, pinching the dough together tightly so no dip escapes. Lightly roll it into a rope and form a pretzel shape by turning each of the ends toward the middle. Gently pinch the ends of the dough to the center, so the ends stay in place.
* Preheat oven to 425℉.
* On the stove, boil a pot of water. Once it has reached boiling, slowly add baking soda to the water a little bit at a time. Each time you add some baking soda, you’ll see the water fizz up (this is the reason to take it very slowly).  
* Once the baking soda is incorporated into the water, using a slotted spoon or strainer spoon, gently place each pretzel into the water and let boil for 30 seconds each, occasionally bathing the tops of the pretzels with the water.
* After boiling for 30 seconds each, lift each pretzel out of the water using the slotted spoon and place onto a baking sheet. Make an egg wash with 1 egg and a few drops of water, and whisk. Brush each pretzel with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse salt. 
* Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown. Enjoy!"

If you like recipes that include lots of wild game and exotic meats they have a couple more on there that are really good. But this one is gotta be my absolute favourite way to eat pancakes now!

**Ingredients**

**For the pancakes** 

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

3 tablespoons sugar

2 large eggs, lightly beaten

3 cups buttermilk

4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 1/2 teaspoon for griddle

**For the Sponge Toffee** 

Vegetable oil, to grease the pan

Over medium-high heat bring the mixture to a boil (without stirring) and cook until hard crack stage, i.e. until temperature reads 300 degrees F. on a candy thermometer. This should take about 10 minutes. During the cooking process, if there are any sugar crystals on the sides of the pan, brush the sides of the pan with a clean pastry brush dipped in water.

3. Remove the sugar mixture from the heat. Working quickly, add the baking soda and whisk to incorporate the soda into the sugar mixture, about 5 seconds. Note the mixture will bubble up when you add the baking soda so be very careful not to touch the hot toffee. Immediately pour the hot toffee into the prepared pan. Let cool and set completely before touching. Break into pieces and set aside.

Add eggs, buttermilk, and 4 tablespoons butter; whisk to combine. Batter should have small to medium lumps. 

6. Using a pastry brush, brush remaining 1/2 teaspoon of butter or reserved bacon fat onto the griddle. Wipe off excess. 

7. Using a 4-ounce ladle, about 1/2 cup, pour pancake batter, in pools 2 inches away from one other. When pancakes have bubbles on top and are slightly dry around edges, about 2 1/2 minutes, flip over. Cook until golden on bottom, about 1 minute. 

8. Repeat with remaining batter, keeping finished pancakes on a heatproof plate in the still warn  oven.

9. In a small sauce pot pour in your maple syrup and add the apple butter, mix apple butter into syrup until thoroughly combined and warm.

8. To serve, stack your pancakes layering the cakes with your now cooked wild boar bacon. pour over your apple butter syrup, add some crumbled sponge toffee, whipped cream, then pickled cranberries and sprinkle with a liberal amount of icing sugar. Enjoy!"

*INGREDIENTS FOR 12-16 BARS*

Base layer:

\- Graham wafer crumbs or, alternatively, digestive biscuits \[1.75 cups / 180 g\]

\- coconut flakes \[1 cup / 75 g\]

\- finely chopped almonds \[1/2 cup / 50 g\]

\- unsalted butter \[1/2 cup / 110 g\]

\- fine/caster sugar \[1/4 cup / 45 g\]

\- cocoa powder \[5 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- 1 fresh egg

Custard icing layer:

\- unsalted butter \[1/2 cup / 110 g\]

\- heavy cream \[3 tbsp / 50 ml\]

\- Bird's custard powder \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

\- icing sugar \[2 cups / 200 g\]

Coating:

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- semi-sweet chocolate \[4 oz / 120 g\]

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. For the 1st layer: Pulverize crackers, if you can't find Graham wafer crumbs, and - in a big enough bowl - mix those with the finely shredded coconut flakes as well as almonds and set aside
2. Melt butter in a double boiler (""bain-marie""). Whisk in sugar and cacao till well combined, before adding a beaten egg.  When adding the egg, make sure that you're simultaneously whisking the mass, in order for the egg to be incorporated fast. Otherwise you'll end up with junks of scrambled eggs. Continue whisking for a few minutes, till all ingredients unite and the mass thickens
3. Combine ingredients from steps 1 & 2 and distribute over your 8x8 inch / 20x20 cm form. Evenly spread and press it with your spatula to a firm mass, leaving no space in between
4. For the 2nd layer: In a clean bowl, drop the warm butter, and unite it with the cream, custard powder and icing sugar. Once you get an even mass, you gotta grab your whisk and fluff it up! This took me 10-15 minutes, but if you have a proper electric whisk, you'll get there sooner 
5. Now spread that custard icing over the 1st layer of almond-coco-cracker
6. For the 3rd layer, combine the butter an chocolate in the double boiler till fully emulsified, which shouldn't take too long
7. Before pouring it over the 2nd layer, let cool down a bit, till not hot anymore, but still liquid. Evenly spread the chocolate, but be very careful and don't press it into the custard layer. I elevated the form and changed the angle and let the chocolate run all over. It worked out alright
8. Cover the form with plastic wrap and let chill in your fridge for at least 3 hours, before serving! I noticed that it tasted better, when kept in fridge overnight
9. Enjoy!

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/p11c5u,https://i.redd.it/grdb98y82cg71.jpg,reddit,"**Ingredients (Serves 2 as an appetizer)**

* 125g ball of burrata
* 2 small-medium heirloom tomatoes (around 120g)\*
* Flaky sea salt
* Good quality extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 sprigs of fresh basil, thinly sliced (leaves only)
* Zest of 1 lemon
* (Optional but recommended) 1 tbsp aged balsamic or balsamic glaze

**Instructions**

* Slice the tomatoes thinly, crosswise, with a serrated knife (around 0.5cm or less). Distribute them on a serving plate and sprinkle with some flaky sea salt and thinly sliced basil leaves.\*
* If using balsamic - drizzle it evenly over the tomatoes at this stage.
* Gently place the burrata ball to the center of the plate on top of the tomatoes.
* Drizzle the burrata and tomatoes with around 2 tbsp of olive oil, then zest around ½ to 1 lemon over the mix. Serve immediately with some crusty bread if desired.

**Notes**

* If using cherry tomatoes, cut them in half or quarters depending on their size. Also, I'd recommend serving in a shallow bowl by placing the burrata ball to the center first and then adding the tomato wedges around it.
* Regular balsamic vinegar doesn’t work as well here - whenever I don’t have aged balsamic or glaze on hand, I prefer simply omitting it.
* For presentation, I kept my basil leaves whole but it’s easier to slice them thinly and sprinkle them evenly over the tomatoes.

**Sauce:**

* 4 ounces fresh squeezed orange juice
* 2 teaspoons orange zest
* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 4 tablespoons light brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon chili oil, optional
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch

**Chicken:**

* 2–3 tablespoons neutral oil
* 1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon white pepper

**Aromatics:**

* 2 teaspoons neutral oil, as needed, divided
* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps sliced and stems discarded
* 2 teaspoons freshly minced ginger
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2–3 bird’s eye chilies, trimmed and minced
* 2 scallions, minced

**For serving:**

* Sliced scallion greens, crispy shallots, or sesame seeds
* Cooked white rice

**Prepare all the ingredients:**

1. Before beginning, prepare all of the fresh ingredients and have them ready

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Place all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and whisk until the cornstarch is completely incorporated into the liquid and no lumps remain. Set aside.

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Place a skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the neutral oil and allow it to heat as you prepare the chicken.
2. Put the diced chicken in a bowl and season it with salt and white pepper. Sprinkle the cornstarch on top and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix until all the chicken is coated.
3. Turn the heat on the skillet to medium-high. Once the oil is hot and shimmering in the skillet, arrange a batch of the chicken in an even layer, ensuring that the chicken isn’t crowded. Cook for 4–6 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a bowl and continue cooking the chicken in batches until all of the chicken is fried.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. If the pot is dry, add 1 teaspoon neutral oil. Add the mushrooms and season all over with salt. Cook for 4–5 minutes until they are a light golden brown all over. Shiitakes dry out very quickly, so be sure not to cook them too long! Transfer them to the bowl of cooked chicken.

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in the skillet. Add the minced ginger, garlic, chili peppers, and scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Cook the sauce:**

1. Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, for 3–5 minutes until the sauce becomes very thick. If it begins to stick, reduce the heat to low.

**Sauce the chicken:**

1. Pour the cooked chicken and mushrooms into the sauce and toss to coat. Continue tossing over low heat for 2–3 minutes until the chicken is completely coated and the sauce thickens a bit more. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings if needed. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the chicken over cooked white rice. Garnish with sliced scallions, crispy shallots, or sesame seeds. Enjoy!"

So I came up with my own version using ingredients I always have. You can learn how to [make it on video here](https://www.nataliecooks.com/recipes/buffalo-grilled-chicken-tacos-with-blue-cheese-sauce). 

**Ingredients**

**For the chicken:**

* 1.5-2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 4 tbsp butter
* ½-1 tsp red pepper flakes (depending on spice level)
* ¼ cup tomato paste
* 2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
* 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 ½ tsp kosher salt, divided 

***For the blue cheese sauce:\****

* 1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt
* ½ cup crumbled blue cheese
* 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
* ½ tsp kosher salt

**For the tacos:**

* 4-8 flour tortillas
* 2 cups shredded lettuce (iceberg, romaine, or use cabbage)
* 1-2 tomatoes, chopped (optional)
* Cilantro (optional)

**Instructions**  
1. Heat the grill on high for at least 10 minutes. In a bowl, add the chicken, olive oil, and ½ teaspoon salt and toss to coat. 

2. Grill the chicken for about 5 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Once cooked, slice, chop or shred up the chicken.  
3. In a small pot over medium-low heat, add the butter and red pepper flakes and melt the butter. Once the butter has melted and starts bubbling on the edges, let it keep bubbling gently to toast those spices for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then remove from heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Transfer to a high-speed blender.   
4. In the blender along with the butter, add the tomato paste, soy, vinegar, garlic, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and blend until smooth.  
5. Pour the sauce into a large bowl. Add the chopped grilled chicken and toss to coat.   
6. Rinse out the blender and add the yogurt, blue cheese, vinegar, and salt and blend until combined (you want it a little chunky). If it won’t blend easily, add a splash or two of water or more yogurt. You could also just mix it together in a bowl if you crumble your blue cheese really finely.  
7. Warm your tortillas and top with buffalo chicken, lettuce, tomatoes (if using) and top with the blue cheese sauce and cilantro.  


**Substitutions:**  
To make vegetarian, substitute baked tofu cubes in place of the chicken.   
To make vegan, see above and replace the butter with a vegan butter alternative. You could also try using olive oil but I have not tested this. Make my yogurt ranch using a vegan yogurt alternative.  
To make gluten-free, use gluten-free tortillas (Siete brand cassava tortillas are my favorite. Or turn it into a bowl or salad with tortilla chips."

**Ingredients**

Dough

- 4 1/2 – 3/4 cups Bread Flour separated (1st: 2 cups, then 2 cups, then 1/2 - - cup, then optional 1/4 cup)
- 1/3 cup Granulated Sugar
- 2 packets Instant Yeast

- 2 tbsp Cinnamon

Cream Cheese Frosting

- 1 package Cream Cheese
- 1/2 cup Salted Butter
- 2 cups Powdered Sugar
- 1 tsp Vanilla Bean Paste or vanilla extract

**Instructions**

Dough

1. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of flour with sugar and yeast. Whisk to sift and aerate the mixture. Set aside.
2. In a heat proof bowl/cup, heat butter together with milk in a microwave for 45 seconds (Note: not all the butter will be melted! The milk should be warm to the touch but not hot. If the mixture is hot, let it cool slightly before adding to the yeast/flour mixture).
3. Add the milk/butter mixture and egg to the flour/yeast mixture. Mix together with a wooden spoon until a thick, wet mixture is formed. Add an additional 2 cups of flour and mix to fully incorporate. Finally, add an additional 1/2 cup of flour until a soft dough is formed.
4. Knead together dough until it becomes homogenous, smooth, and soft. (Note: if the dough continues to stick to your fingers, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour and incorporate it into the dough). The final mixture should bounce back after a finger is indented into it. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, uncovered.
5. Roll dough into a 15"" by 12"" rectangle.

Cinnamon Filling & Assembly

1. Spread softened butter over surface of the dough rectangle, leaving a 1/2"" border that is butter free.
Combine brown sugar with cinnamon. Sprinkle cinnamon mixture over butter layer.
2. Roll dough from the 15"" end into a thick log. Once rolling is complete, gently push together both ends of the log to make them even. Divide dough into 12 pieces by scoring the surface of the log. Using an unflavoured piece of floss, slide floss underneath log and pull up to cut log (Note: this step prevents squishing the cinnamon rolls during the cutting process).
3. Place cinnamon rolls into a buttered 9""x13"" pan. Cover with a towel and place in a warm location to proof for 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 350F (325F convection oven). Bake for 30-35 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Let cool for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cream cheese frosting.

Cream Cheese Frosting

1. In a medium sized bowl, combine softened butter with cream cheese. Start by mashing with a fork/spoon until creamy. Add powdered sugar and vanilla paste/extract then mix together until mixture resembles a clumpy paste. Finally, use a whisk to beat together icing.
2. Spread a generous layer of cream cheese icing onto the tops of the warm cinnamon rolls. Serve and enjoy!"

Original recipe and come tips - [https://mikedes.com/en/chicken-thighs-with-garlic-and-spices/](https://mikedes.com/en/chicken-thighs-with-garlic-and-spices/)

**Ingredients**

* Chicken thighs – 8 pcs
* Salt – 2 teaspoons
* Garlic – 6 cloves
* Oregano – 1 teaspoon
* Ground red pepper – 2 teaspoons
* Sunflower oil – 3 tablespoons

**Cooking**

1. Pat thighs dry with paper towels and put in a deep container.
2. Crush three cloves of garlic, mix with salt and other spices and coat the thighs well. (You can take more garlic, crush some and coat the chicken, and bake some whole garlic)
3. Add sunflower oil to the container, mix and leave the chicken warm for 1 hour (covered with a film or lid)
4. Heat the oven to 200 degrees °C
5. After an hour, put the chicken on a baking sheet, unpeeled garlic cloves there and put in the oven
6. After 35-40 minutes, the thighs are ready.

\*The baking sheet can be covered with baking paper (parchment), and the chicken will not stick to the baking sheet, and it is easier to clean it later.

\*The juice and marinade from the chicken will soak the garlic cloves, and it will turn out very tasty. Unless, of course, you love roasted garlic. By the way, if you put a whole head of garlic, then you can make a good garlic sauce from it.

That’s the whole recipe!

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 10 minutes

Total Time: 25 minutes

Servings:  6

&#x200B;

Ingredients

* 1 Ciabatta Baguette *cut in half to make approx. two 12-inch pieces*
* 2-3 Tbsp butter
* 3 red peppers
* 1 large bunch of arugula, rinsed and patted dry *rinsed and patted dry*
* 2 cups bocconcini slices
* 10 oz Assorted Italian deli meats *(I used Soppressata Salami, Capocollo and Napoli Salami)*
* Balsamic Vinegar
* Olive Oil
* Salt and Pepper, to taste

### Instructions

1. To roast the red peppers: Set your oven to the Broil setting. Slice the sides off the red peppers and place skin side up on a baking sheet (\*I like to trim the ends so they lie as flat as possible, as they will brown better than pieces that are sloped). Place under the broiler until very well charred (blacon top, about 10 minutes (watch closely after 5 minutes. You'll want them to be mostly blackened on top.) Remove from the oven and immediately place the peppers in a plastic ziploc bag. Pop in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes. Remove peppers from bag and peel off the blackened skin with a knife. Discard the skin and slice the peppers in to strips. Place in a bowl and drizzle with a bit of olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.
2. To prepare the sandwiches: Cut your ciabatta in half and butter each piece (or you could brush with a bit of olive oil, if you prefer, but butter will help prevent moisture from getting into the bread. Place a generous layer of cold meats (4-5 over-lapping layers). Top with cooled roasted red pepper strips. Take your Bocconcini slices and place on a piece of paper towel. Top with another piece of paper towel and pat to dry a bit. Top the red peppers with a layer of the Bocconcini slices. Drizzle some balsamic vinegar over the Bocconcini slices and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with a generous layer of arugula. Top with top slice of ciabatta.
3. Wrap each sandwich tightly with plastic wrap and place on a platter or baking sheet. When all the sandwiches are prepared, place the platter in the refrigerator. Place a heavy skillet on top of sandwiches to apply weight (if you don't have a heavy skillet, top with another baking sheet and place some large cans on top for the weight).
4. Refrigerate at least 6 hours or ideally, overnight.
5. When ready to serve, remove from plastic wrap. If desired, you can trim the sides and ends of the sandwiches to make neat sides and to enjoy the wonderful colours of these sandwiches."

**Ingredients**

* 4 cups of raw cashews
* a teaspoon of rosemary
* 4-5 small sweet potatoes (or 3 large ones)
* 3 teaspoon of smoked paprika
* a can of chickpeas

* salt and pepper to your liking

**Directions**

1. In a pot with salted boiling water, boil the cashews and the rosemary until they're soft.
2. Cut the sweet potatoes in small pieces and them steam them until cooked through.
3. Let the cashews cool a little bit and them blend them along with 3 tablespoon of the cooking water (you can blend the rosemary too)
4. In a pan with very hot olive oil cook the chickpeas until crispy. When they're almost done, add the smoked paprika (so it won't burn and taste bitter).
5. In the same pan, add some more olive oil and cook the tuscan kale until it has some char (you have to add salt immediately here to make it crispy)
6. Serve the puree making a little well in the center where you are going to put the chickpeas and kale.

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/g057tf,https://i.redd.it/knpunwf9ggs41.jpg,reddit,"I was inspired by vineyardbaker on Instagram and decided to try focaccia bread art for Easter. I used the recipe from [this site](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/19313/easy-focaccia-bread-recipe-with-herbs/) for the focaccia.

\>**Ingredients**

\>1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil

\>2 garlic cloves, finely minced *\[I used 5, but my husband and I are garlic fiends\]*

\>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried

\>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried

\>1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

\>1 cup (235 ml) warm water

\>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)

\>1/4 teaspoon honey

\>2 1/2 cups (315 grams) all-purpose flour

\>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt

**Directions**

In a cold medium skillet, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, and the black pepper. Place the pan over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes or until aromatic, but before the garlic browns. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and honey. Stir a few times then let sit for 5 minutes.

Add 1 cup of the flour and a 1/4 cup of the infused garlic-olive oil mixture to the bowl with yeast and honey. Stir 3 to 4 times until the flour has moistened. Let sit for another 5 minutes.

Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. When the dough comes together, transfer to a floured board and knead 10 to 15 times until smooth.

Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise for 1 hour. (It’s best to let the dough rise in a warmer area of your kitchen).

After 1 hour, heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

Use two tablespoons of the remaining garlic-olive oil mixture to oil a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. (See above if you do not have this pan size).

Transfer the dough to the baking sheet then press it down into the pan. Use your fingers to dimple the dough then drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the garlic-olive oil mixture. Let the dough rise for 20 minutes until it puffs slightly.

**This is where I slightly deviated from the website's recipe.**

I added sliced bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives, black olives, green olives, cauliflower, and sprigs of thyme, rosemary, dill, and chives for the springtime decor. Just pressed slightly down into the dough. Then back to the original recipe.

Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool baked focaccia bread on a wire rack. *\[I ended up lowering the heat to 350 after 15 min and continued baking for another 6-ish minutes. It was slightly hard to the touch at this point instead of springy and I was worried I had overcooked it, but once it cooled and we cut into it, it was PERFECT.\]*"
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/g15rq8,https://i.redd.it/e5jxei1qess41.jpg,reddit,"Here is the recipe, but there is a full step-by-step picture guide on r/mumteachessontocook – I hope you love it as much as we did!

Ingredients:

200g lentils – I used green/brown coloured ones\*

2 medium onions (mine weighed 260g, unpeeled)

3 medium carrots (mine weighed 270g, unpeeled)

5 medium potatoes (any variety, but waxy are delicious – mine weighed 540g, unpeeled)

4 cloves of garlic (mine were fairly small, but if you love garlic, please do add more!)

EITHER ½ can drained tomatoes (210g - chopped, or whole) OR around 210g fresh tomatoes

2 bay leaves (dried or fresh)

Celery – 2 large ribs, or a few small sticks and the heart

Plenty of extra virgin olive oil (or the best oil you have)

A sprig of fresh thyme or small twig of fresh rosemary

1 tablespoon of paprika (not smoked)

Chicken or vegetable stock concentrate (I used 2 cubes of this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MumTeachesSonToCook/comments/f3e2up/perfect\_chicken\_stock\_the\_stepbystep\_holy\_grail/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MumTeachesSonToCook/comments/f3e2up/perfect_chicken_stock_the_stepbystep_holy_grail/)) – OR 1.5 litres of ready to use stock

1.5 teaspoons of fine salt (use less if your stock is salty)

Plenty of ground black pepper

3 tablespoons of lemon juice (squeezy bottle is fine)

A little fresh, finely chopped flat leaf parsley to serve, if you have it  

\*Please use any lentils you happen to have, but the cooking times may differ – for example, my greeny-brown ones took 30 minutes, whereas the orange split variety will cook faster. Puy (posh) lentils will take a little longer – but we’ll cover this later on, not to worry.

Method:

Check your lentils for small stones by spreading a couple of dessert spoons onto a white plate / tray and shake from side to side; any interloping stones should be immediately visible and removed.  Repeat until all your lentils have been checked then transfer to a sieve and rinse well under cold running water.  Set aside.

Scrub, then top and tail your celery, before finely chopping into small dice.  If your celery ribs are large, outer specimens, then top and tail and run a speed peeler down the outer curved edge to remove the tough strings, then finely chop.

Peel, top and tail, then finely chop your carrots, onions and garlic

Peel your potatoes and cut into 2cm dice (or thereabouts!).

Add a good amount of olive oil to a large saucepan and place onto a high heat then add your celery, carrots and onions.

Cook until the edges are a little golden and they have softened (around 8 minutes), stirring constantly.

Add your garlic, bay leaves and level tablespoon of paprika.  Turn the heat down and stir – cook for another 2 minutes.

Next add your thyme (or rosemary) and plenty of ground black pepper (I added 2 teaspoons because it is quite a robust dish), then stir.

Next add your lentils and stir to coat them in the paprika-y oil.

Now add either 1.5 litres of ready to use stock, or 1.5 litres of water and your chosen concentrate, then turn your heat back up to high.  If you are using small orange (red) split lentils, add your potatoes now.  If not, wait a little longer.

Next wash your tomatoes and cut into chunks about the size of a large date (removing the tough green core).  The tomatoes don’t have to be peeled.  If you are using canned tomatoes, drain and chop.  Add your tomatoes to the pan and stir.

Bring to a gentle boil, then cover with a lid.  Turn down to a steady simmer and cook for 15 minutes. 

If you are using larger, sturdier lentils, add your potatoes once the 15 minutes are up, along with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir and bring back to a gentle boil for 15 minutes or so (without the lid).

Check your lentils are cooked – they should be softly yielding, but still retaining a little shape.  If they need a little more cooking, pop the lid back on and give them another 5 minutes.

When you are happy everything is cooked – your potatoes are meltingly soft and the lentils, tender – remove the bay leaves, thyme/rosemary sprigs and any stray tomato skins that you might see floating around at the top.  Taste your dish – then add enough salt to season properly, along with a few more grinds of black pepper.  

Switch off the heat. Now add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, stir and taste, adding slightly more if the dish tastes a little “flat”. Lentils love acid!

Ladle into bowls and serve with plenty of crusty bread and a sprinkle of chopped flat leaf parsley, if you have any."

For full recipe, tips, tricks, and variation ideas, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/creamy-mushroom-pasta/](https://maplewoodroad.com/creamy-mushroom-pasta-without-cream/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 4 oz pasta of your choice
* 12 oz fresh mushrooms of your choice (portobello, cremini, shiitake), chopped
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoon butter
* 1 shallot, finely chopped (about ½ c)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 Tbsp)
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* ½ c fresh herbs, such as parsley, sage, rosemary
* ½ c white wine (or pasta water)\*
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* ½ c pasta water
* 2 oz (½ c) finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan)
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
* 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, or more to taste

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Start by bringing a pot of salted water to a rolling boil for the pasta.
2. Next, add a tablespoon of olive oil to your saute pan and bring to medium heat.
3. Add the chopped mushrooms and let them saute. They’ll brown on the edges and will release some of their liquid. Stir a couple of times and cook for about 4 minutes.
4. Next, add the butter, shallots, salt, and pepper, and cook for 2 minutes.
5. Add the garlic, mustard, tomato paste, and the herbs and stir very well so that everything is mixed well.
6. After just another minute (you never want to overcook the garlic or your dinner might be toast), add the wine and lemon juice.
7. Taste. If you think it needs more salt, add some. But be mindful, we’ll still add the starchy pasta water and Parmesan, which will both add more salt.
8. Lastly, add the grated Parmesan and the pasta water and stir.
9. Toss with the pasta and mix everything very well.
10. Sprinkle with some extra Italian parsley and serve immediately.

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound fresh salmon fillet skinned
* ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs
* ½ medium red bell pepper finely chopped
* ¼ cup grated yellow onion see below for details
* 1 large garlic clove minced
* 1 large egg lightly beaten
* 1 tablespoon fresh chives finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon fresh Italian parsley finely chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Vegetable or canola oil for frying
* Lemon wedges to serve



**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 450℉. Place salmon in a dry baking dish and bake for 14-18 minutes until the center starts to flake, or the internal temperature reaches 135-145℉.
2. While salmon is in the oven, grate a yellow onion with the coarse setting of a cheese grater. The grated onion will look like watery apple sauce. Add grated yellow onion, panko, bell pepper, garlic, egg, chives, parsley, and salt and pepper to a medium bowl.
3. When salmon is done, transfer to a plate and use two forks to shred salmon into little pieces. After it cools for a few minutes (so egg doesn’t scramble), add salmon to the bowl with other ingredients. Mix until well-combined.
4. Use a ¼ cup measure to make ¼ cup-sized balls, placing them on a large plate or baking sheet. You should be able to make roughly 11 balls.
5. Once the balls are formed, lightly push the balls down to make thick patties. Ensure the ingredients are tightly packed/squeezed together so the patties don’t fall apart.
6. Add ½ inch of oil to a large pan. Turn heat to medium-high and wait until the oil registers 325-350℉
7. Once the oil has reached temperature, very carefully slide croquettes into the pan (using a spatula), ensuring they don’t break apart. You can add as many as possible without overcrowding. Cook croquettes for 1-2 minutes per side until deep golden. If you turn the croquettes prematurely, they’ll fall apart.
8. Use a slotted spatula to remove the croquettes from the oil, placing on a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle generously with salt.
9. Repeat until all croquettes are fried. Serve with lemon wedges."

- 4 bone-in chicken thighs
- chicken stock
- 2 quarts mushrooms (sliced). I use a combination of portabello and shiitake.
- sesame oil

Directions:

1. Mix marinade ingredients well and allow chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Preheat oven to 350F.
3. Saute mushrooms in sesame oil until golden brown. Set aside.
4. Place chicken thighs skin side down in an oven-safe pan (I use a cast iron) on stove top. Let the chicken and pan warm up to medium heat together. Set marinade aside.
5. When skin has browned (3-4 minutes), flip chicken and allow the underside to brown (1-2 minutes).
6. Add marinade to pan. Add chicken stock to pan until liquid covers 2/3 of the chicken, with only the skin sticking out on top.
7. Add mushrooms to liquid. Be careful not to cover chicken with them.
8. Carefully move the pan to the oven. Let it braise in the oven for 30-35 minutes, checking occasionally and spoon liquid over chicken.
9. Turn on the broiler to crisp up the skin again. Watch carefully, as it can burn. Should only take 1-2 minutes or even less.
10. Take pan out of oven and back to the stove top. Turn up heat and reduce liquid until sauce is thick."

__You will need:__

- 130g plain flour 
- 3/4 tsp baking powder 
- 30g sugar 
- a pinch of salt 
- 1 tsp vanilla extract 
- 1/2 tsp lemon juice 
- 25g (plant-based) butter 
- 7 tbsp aquafaba (or 1 egg yolk and 3 egg whites) 
- 1/2 tsp cream of tartar 
- 1 package bourbon vanilla sugar (9g - I used the one from Dr.Oetker) 
- 1 tsp lemon juice 
- 150ml (plant-based) milk


__Instructions:__

1. Mix 1 tsp of lemon juice and milk together, let it sit for at least 10 minutes until it starts to curd. Meanwhile, mix dry ingredients together (flour, vanilla sugar, baking powder, salt). 

2. Melt the butter and add to the milk-lemon juice mixture together with vanilla extract and 1 tbsp aquafaba (replacement for 1 yolk). Add it slowly to the dry mixture and mix until there's no clumps and the batter is smooth (like on the 2nd picture).

3. In a seperate bowl, add 1/2 tsp lemon juice and cream of tartar to 6 tbsp of aquafaba (replacement for 3 egg whites). Beat with a hand mixer until the texture turns slightly foamy, then start gradually adding sugar 10ish grams at a time. You will want to beat for about 10 minutes, until the peaks are semi-firm.

4. Take 2 tablespoons of the whipped aquafaba and stir it into the batter, then slowly add the rest of it and gently fold into the batter. Don't mix, try to maintain the airy consistency.

5. Splash a bit of oil on a pan (I'm using coconut oil), let the pan heat up and add 3 scoops of batter onto it, let it cook for a minute or two and add another smaller scoop on top of the pancakes.

6. Flip them when the bottom is starting to brown.

7. Cover them with a lid and allow them to cook through. It really depends on your stove and pan how long you'll need to cook them, so the first batch will probably be an experiment. For me 5 minutes on one side and 8-10 minutes on the other side works best.

They are super fluffy and soft, they literally melt on your tongue. I hope you give these a try!"
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hooh8j,https://i.redd.it/gd3tfq5c11a51.jpg,reddit,"**INGREDIENTS: (2 servings)**

* Your preferred brand of Japanese curry roux block (use 2 servings)
* 150g of minced beef
* 1 small carrot
* ½ yellow onion
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 3 small button/portobello mushrooms 
* 350-400 ml of water
* Freshly cooked medium grain or Japanese rice, about 1 cup/serving
* 3 medium fresh eggs
* Oil, salt, black pepper and a 20cm non-stick pan for the tornado omelette

**COOKING STEPS:**

**1.** **Curry sauce**

* Season minced beef with some salt and grounded black pepper
* Finely dice carrot, yellow onion, garlic and mushroom
* Heat up 1 tbs of oil in a pot, then add minced beef, allow to brown. It’s fine if they stick a little.
* Cook these ingredients for 2 mins each, in this order: onion, then carrot & garlic, and finally mushroom.
* Add water. You can add 350ml first, and if the curry gets too thick later, add another 50ml or so.
* Simmer for 15 mins, then add 2 servings of curry roux block. Stir well, simmer for another 15 mins, add extra water or season if needed and it’s done! Reheat before serving.
* (Optional) You can use some of these: Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, Japanese soy sauce, sugar, honey and grated apple to compose the right balance for your sauce. I used Java brand (hot), so I added 1tbs soy sauce, 1tbs Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbs ketchup and 1 tbs sugar to my sauce.

**2.** **Tips**

* Use a good non-stick 20cm frying pan
* Use very fresh eggs, at room temperature. Old eggs are too watery
* Practice using chopsticks to grab and rotate the imaginary eggs while moving the pan
* Use chopsticks to grab at 45˚ then raise to 90˚, right hand turns the eggs while left hand moves the pan slightly to left & right
* Use a small burner with medium heat for small pan
* Whisk 3 eggs well, then strain to smoothen. Spoon out smaller bubbles.
* Be gentle but also pretty quick to turn the eggs, otherwise it will be hardened and impossible to turn.

**3.** **Rice**

* In a deep plate, shape hot rice like a volcano

**4.** **Tornado Omelette**

* Add 1 tbs of oil, brush the oil on the edge of the pan as well
* Use medium heat, move pan and oil around to heat up evenly
* When the pan gets to medium hot, pour the eggs mixture in, let it set for a few seconds
* Once the edge of the eggs turns white, grab and turn gently. W the inner circle is formed, use the resistance in the cooked eggs to turn more rounds. The more layers you could make, the more beautiful it will look later.
* Use the other hand to move the pan, also tilt to redistribute and cook the remaining runny eggs.
* Keep the chopsticks in the eggs and use them to help placing the eggs nicely on top of the rice. Remove gently.
* Add a lot of curry sauce around the eggs and enjoy!

* 180g chocolate from a bar, chopped (I used 100g dark and 80g milk, use what you like here), plus extra for pressing on top, if desired

**Instructions**

1. Place the butter in a medium saucepan, and place over medium heat. Cook until the butter has melted, and then continue to cook, swirling the pan often, until the butter foams and turns golden brown and nutty - this should take 3-4 minutes.
2. Measure out 95g of the brown butter into a medium or large mixing bowl, and set aside for 15-20 minutes to cool so that it doesn't scramble your eggs.When the butter is cool, add the brown sugar and white sugar, and whisk briefly to incorporate.
3. Add the egg and whisk well for 1-2 minutes, or mix using an electric mixer, until the mixture has lightened in colour and has thickened.
4. Add the vanilla and mix well.
5. Add the flour, salt, espresso powder if using, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix to combine with a rubber spatula until there are some flour streaks remaining - this is to ensure you do not over work the dough.
6. Add the chopped chocolate and mix with a spatula to incorporate and finish incorporating the flour.
7. Line a quarter sheet pan or other container with parchment paper. Using a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop, scoop balls of dough (approx 55g) , arranging them on the parchment (they can be touching). Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.
8. 10 minutes into the chilling period, preheat the oven to 350°f / 180°c.  Line two sheet pans with parchment paper.
9. Arrange 6 cookie dough balls onto the pan. If desired, flatten each ball of dough, press more chocolate on the top, and roll into a ball, then space evenly on the pan.
10. Bake the cookies for 11-13 minutes, or until set around the edges and golden brown. Bake for closer to 11 minutes for still gooey inside, or 12-13 for more set cookies.
11. Remove from the oven, and if desired, use a cookie cutter slightly bigger than the cookies to 'scoot' them into a round shape.
12. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt if using. Leave to cool on the pan for 10-15 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.
13. Repeat the baking process with the remaining 6 balls of dough.

For the risotto: (taken from my previous post)

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 300g arborio
- Handful parsley
- 50g grated parmesan
- Dried thyme
- 25g butter
- Salt & pepper
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2  chicken stock (1.5 litres)
- 250-500 grams pack white mushrooms
- 1 x 175ml glass white wine

Start off with sweating out and slightly browning the onions. Then once that is done, add in mushrooms and 50 grams of butter, this might take a while so cook them down until their wilted and browned. After, put in your garlic, thyme, salt and pepper and stir well until it slightly caramelised.

In the video instructions I added in the white wine and rice at the same time - I know this isn’t the traditional method, and that you’re supposed to toast the rice first and then add the wine, but I was a little short on time and I find that doing it this wine it tastes just as good.

So go ahead and toast your rice and cook out the alcohol from the wine, then start ladling in your chicken stock.

I ladled in two spoonfuls at a time in intervals of 3-4 minutes until the liquid has almost completely reduced. Do this until you’ve used all your stock or until your rice has become soft and slightly al denté.

Afterwards, turn off the heat and add in 50 grams of grated parmesan and a handful of finely chopped parsley.


For the arancini:

- Risotto (enough to make 12 golfball sized arancini)
- All purpose flour (enough to cover 12 arancini, ~150 grams)
- Panko breadcrumbs (enough to cover 12 arancini, so ~100-150 grams)
- 3 Eggs
- 1 liter canola oil
- A pinch of shredded mozzarella cheese for 12 arancini
- Handful of freshly chopped parsley (for garnish)
- Handful of freshly chopped basil (for garnish)
- Freshly grated Parmesan

Make sure your risotto is cooled completely before forming then into balls. 

Depending on how much risotto you have start by forming your risotto into however many balls you can.

Next, flatten them slightly with the palm of your hands, and put a pinch of mozzarella cheese in the centre. Close the risotto back into a ball firmly, make sure there are no open cracks that would cause the arancini to open during the frying process.

After, cover your arancini in flour, some egg and a light coating of panko breadcrumbs. Then you’re ready to start frying!

Have whatever frying oil you want at a temperature of 175 degrees Celsius (~350 Fahrenheit) and place your arancini in at batches of 3-4. Cook for about 5-6 minutes - this is to make sure the cheese inside has completely melted. 

Afterwards, let them rest on some paper towels to dry off any excess oil. Then you’re just about done! Serve with whatever tomato sauce or garnish you want. I recommend a healthy amount of grated Parmesan on top!"
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/mtbrwd,https://i.redd.it/oy9g3405cxt61.jpg,reddit,"Cochinita Tacos are one of the most popular foods in the Mexican region of Yucatan. Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours. The meat is then mixed with the cooking juices, served on a corn tortilla with red onion pickle. Taco is garnished with cilantro or parsley. Sometimes salsa or guacamole is also served as a topping but it is a personal preference.

At home, I used a slow-cooker on a low setting. 8 pm start for the overnight cook, meat was ready lunchtime on the following day. The only side effect of this method of cooking is sleepless night as the delicious aromas keep you awake...

## What kind of meat is used for Cochinita Pibil Tacos?

Traditionally, hairless Mexican pig is used for Cochinitas. For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.

To prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference. Next time I will definitely try ribs or belly.

Remember to choose the best quality meat from sources that respect animal life and consumers health!

I find even just searing it in butter unnecessary, as it'll grill in its own fat with no added oil, and come out every bit as moist and flavorful.

If you can't find Chilean seabass in store, this marinade works great with salmon, cod, or branzino.  You can pan sear this after marinading, but for larger portions oven bake is really convenient and grease-free.

Here is a [**step-by-step video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZlD7hBnEak) for making it.  See [blogpost](http://www.workdaygourmet.net/2019/08/minimalist-miso-marinated-chilean.html) for recipe details & more easy weekday dinners! 

Ingredients:

2 seabass fillets (\~5oz portions)  

2 tbsp miso paste

1 tbsp sake

4 tbsp mirin

1 tsp sugar

suggested sides:

\- roasted or poached vegetables: bok choy, string beans, snow peas, asparagus

\- something starchy: steamed rice, mashed potatoes, or roasted potatoes

Instruction:

Whisk miso with sake, then add the mirin and sugar. Stir until marinade is smooth. Coat the fish with marinade & let sit for \~10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400F and prep some simple sides while waiting. Any poached or grilled vegetables will do. You can add a sheet pan with vegetables to the oven along with your fish. Cook some rice or potatoes for a more hearty meal. 

Place fish on a rack and bake for 10\~15 min. Flip when top side is lightly browned, and bake for another 10\~15 min, or until surface is golden brown. Alternatively you can pan sear this in a non-stick pan on medium high heat, for \~5 minutes per side.

Optional: you can add marinade to pan, bring to a boil, & reduce it into a sauce. Serve fish & sides with reduced sauce."

Here is the breakdown:

**Ingredients:**

**Donuts**

1 cup milk lukewarm

1 tbsp active dry yeast

1/3 cup sugar granulated

3 egg yolks

1 tsp vanilla

4 tbsp butter softened

4 1/4 cups flour all-purpose

1 1/2 tsp salt or to taste

vegetable oil for frying

**Custard filling**

1/2 cup sugar granulated

1/2 tsp salt or to taste

3 tbsp cornstarch

2 cups milk

4 egg yolks

2 tsp vanilla extract

2 tbsp butter unsalted

**Brûlée**

1 cup sugar granulated

1/4 cup water

 

### Instructions

#### Dough

* Whisk the milk, yeast, and 1 tsp of the sugar together. Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes until foamy. Add the egg yolks and vanilla to the yeast mixture. Stir well to combine.
* Add the yeast mixture, flour, butter, salt, and remaining sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and start on low speed, working up to medium speed to combine the dough. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is soft and elastic.
* Place the dough in a large, lightly greased mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free environment for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.

#### Custard

* Whisk the sugar, salt, and cornstarch together. Beat the egg yolks in a medium-sized mixing bowl just until smooth. Add the dry mixture to the egg yolks and continue to beat until combined and pale yellow, about 1 minute.
* Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it comes to a bare simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully ladle the milk into the egg yolk mixture while whisking to avoid lumps. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and return it to the stovetop over medium heat.
* While continuously whisking, heat the mixture until bubbling and completely thickened. Remove the pot from the heat. Whisk the vanilla and butter into the custard until smooth, then transfer the custard to a bowl.
* Cover the custard with plastic wrap, carefully pressing the plastic directly against the surface of the custard to avoid a skin forming. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until completely cooled.

#### Donuts

* Punch the risen dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out until about 1/2"" thick.
* Use a 3"" biscuit or cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough. Knead the remaining dough back into a ball and continue to roll it out and cut rounds until you've used as much dough as you can.
* Place the rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving about 1"" of room between each round. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow them to rise for 20-30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
* Heat the oil in a large pot to 360F. Carefully place the rounds into the hot oil, working in batches. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown, flip and cook for another minute or until golden. Remove the rounds with a slotted spoon and allow the donuts to drain on a paper towel-lined plate while you fry the rest.

#### Fill & Brûlée

* Add the custard to a piping bag fitted with a piping tip. Insert a skewer or chopstick into each donut to create a pocket inside for the custard. Insert the tip of your piping bag into a donut and fill with custard. Repeat with the remaining donuts and custard.
* Add the sugar and water for the caramel (brûlée) to a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the mixture starts bubbling, reduce the heat to medium. Heat the sugar, giving the pan a gentle swirl occasionally, until it turns golden. Take the pan off the heat and swirl the pan until the color deepens slightly.
* Working very carefully, dip the top of each donut into the caramel. Wear a glove for extra protection on your hands. Lift the donut from the caramel and tilt it, away from your fingers, to let the excess drip for a few seconds, then place the donut aside to let it cool.
* Repeat with the remaining donuts. If you find the caramel in the pot is getting too stiff, return it to the heat, swirling the pan, until it warms up and becomes less viscous.

### Notes

**Be careful**! The caramel is **VERY HOT**. Wear a glove to protect your hand while dipping the donuts in the caramel."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k9a3ii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/k9a3ii,reddit,"Excited to share a dish I grew up with! 

The salmon is a super easy weeknight recipe that’s ready in under 25 minutes, and the sauce is something my parents always have a stash of in their fridge, since it pairs well with a ton of different dishes.

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKlH4K1ANA&&list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&index=2&t=0s) for a walkthrough.

# Sourcing Salmon Sustainably

For this specific recipe, my parents bought Atlantic salmon. With regards to Atlantic vs Pacific, farmed or wild-caught, there’s no right or wrong choice, but my parents have a slight preference for Atlantic salmon, which nowadays are primarily farmed. 

As one of the world’s most consumed species of fish, salmon is a massive industry, with several million tons sold every single year, and tons of complexity surrounding how we source it in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way. 

As consumers, an easy way to do our part is by making sure we vote with our wallets. Monterey Bay Aquarium in California runs a free website and mobile app called ""Seafood Watch"" which has a ton of recommendations on how to choose and purchase seafood in ways that have the least environmental impact.

# Salmon + Chinese communities in the west

As I was researching this recipe, I felt like it was important to share how salmon and fishing helped form some of the first Chinese communities in the West.

During the Gold Rush, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Guangzhou, flocked to California enticed by the promise of the Gām Sāan, or gold mountain in Cantonese, although many were forced out of mining work due to discrimination. 

Undeterred, a group of experienced fishermen found their own gold in abalone and other fish along the Monterey coast. Known as China Point by locals, Chinese immigrants proudly sparked the first large scale commercial fishing industry in California, supplying fish and shellfish to countries all over the world. 

During and after the Gold Rush and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, many Chinese immigrants relocated to Seattle, Vancouver, and surrounding areas to work for salmon canneries and on fishing boats, doing the difficult work of supplying and processing most of the world’s salmon at the time.

Today, the once thriving Chinese enclave in Monterey no longer exists, but in spite of periods of intense discrimination and oppression, Seattle and Vancouver are still homes to some of the largest Chinese communities abroad.

## THE RECIPE

Overview

* Prep Time: 10 min
* Total Time: 25 min
* Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients for Salmon

* 1.5 lb **salmon**
* 1 **egg**
* **white pepper** (to taste)
* 3 tbsp **cornstarch**
* 2 tbsp **corn oil**
* 0.50 tbsp **rice cooking wine**
* **garlic salt** (to taste)

Dipping Sauce

* 1 tbsp **sugar**
* 0.50 tbsp **vinegar**
* 2 tbsp **light soy sauce**
* 0.25 tsp **chili sauce** (to taste)
* 2 tbsp **boiling water** (very important)

Optional Garnish

* **cilantro**
* **broccoli**

# Step 1 - Cut salmon

This is totally optional, but if you're planning on garnishing the salmon with anything (like cilantro) or serving it with any vegetables (like broccoli), then it's best to cut it before the salmon (for sanitation).

To make our **salmon** (1.5 lb) fillets, make diagonal cuts about 2 cm apart. The diagonal cuts help increase the surface area of the fillets, which leads to a faster cook and less moisture loss.

# Step 2 - Coat salmon

Spread the fillets out on the cutting board, and sprinkle **white pepper** on each side. The white pepper helps counter some of the ""fishy"" taste of the salmon, which has a slightly negative connotation in Chinese cuisine.

We'll crack and mix our **egg(s)** (1) into a bowl, and spread out **cornstarch** (3 tbsp) on a plate.

Coat each side of each salmon fillet first in the egg, and then the cornstarch. Make sure each side is evenly coated.

This coating helps the salmon retain its juices, and also add some delicious crunchy/crispiness when it's cooked.

# Step 3 - Cook salmon

**Heating the wok**

We’ll set our stove to medium high and let our wok heat up.

Unlike other Chinese recipes, with salmon, it’s important that the wok gets hot enough but not too hot. It’s difficult to give an exact amount of time, since it depends a lot on your stove and cookware.

My dad relies on his own intuition that he’s developed over 50 years of cooking. For the rest of us, he waited about 2-3 minutes on this current setup.

**Cook the salmon**Then, we’ll add **corn oil** (2 tbsp), and swirl it around the wok.

The wok and the oil should be hot enough once the oil starts shimmering, or making ripples.

Once this happens, we’ll add our salmon to the wok.

My dad had just enough room for 8 fillets, so try not to overcrowd your wok and consider cooking in multiple batches if necessary.

The total cooking time for the salmon also varies depending on how hot your stove is, how thick each fillet is, and what type of pan or wok you’re using.

On my dad’s current setup, which has less heat output than a gas stove, he cooked each fillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, generally not flipping the salmon over more than once.

For a visual cue, once the salmon fillet starts to turn more white / yellow-ish, you can flip it.

You should be able to tell if the salmon is done if it easily flakes. If you wanted to get more precise, you can also insert an instant-read food thermometer into the thickest part of the salmon.

**Other tips**

As long as it’s cooked enough, the rest is just a lot of trial and error to find the texture of salmon that’s perfect for you. My dad tends to prefer salmon that’s more medium or well-done, so if you prefer something more rare, then adjust accordingly.

Kenji from the Food Lab has a great blog post and video with a bunch of helpful tips on how to pan fry salmon. Not all of these tips apply to this specific recipe, but it’s still a great resource, and I’ve linked to it in our description.

# Step 4 - Add flavors, cover wok

Add **garlic salt** to the fillets.

Then, we'll add **rice cooking wine** (0.50 tbsp). We should have the lid for the wok within reach, because we’ll be covering the wok immediately after we pour the cooking wine in. We’ll only be covering the wok for about 20 to 30 seconds before we take the lid off.

# Step 5 - Uncover, plate, garnish

Uncover the wok, and turn the heat off. Transfer the salmon fillets to a plate, and add any garnish you'd like.

# Step 6 - Create sauce

To make the sauce, mix together **sugar** (1 tbsp), **vinegar** (0.50 tbsp), **light soy sauce** (2 tbsp), **boiling water** (2 tbsp), and **chili sauce** (0.25 tsp). Mix it all together for about 5-10 seconds.Notes:

* If you prefer more spiciness, feel free to add more chili sauce.
* If you’re wondering why my dad specifically uses boiling water, it’s to help extend the shelf life of the sauce. My parents elaborate on why during our ""Meal Time"".

Adding some prosciutto and rosemary makes it even better! This easy-baked brie appetizer is perfect to please a crowd or for a romantic dinner at home. You can find full recipe with pictures of every step [HERE](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/phyllo-baked-brie-with-prosciutto-and-fig-jam/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 whole Brie Cheese wheel (8oz)
* 4 sheets of Phyllo Dough 
* 4 slices of Prosciutto
* 2 tablespoons of Butter
* 1 sprig of Fresh Rosemary 
* 1 tablespoon Fig Jam 

**DIRECTIONS**

1. **WRAP BRIE IN PROSCIUTTO**

**a.** Preheat oven to 350F/180C. Place 2 tablespoons of butter in a ramekin and place in the oven to melt.  
  
**b.** Start with placing slices of prosciutto in a circular shape, or like a flower, on a cutting board. Place your brie wheel in the center and gently start wrapping it with prosciutto. 

**c.** Add more slices if needed to cover whole cheese. See the pictures below to help you with this step. Nicely chop the rosemary and sprinkle all over wrapped brie. Set it aside.

**2. STACK LAYERS OF PHYLLO DOUGH WITh BUTTER**

This step does sound intimidating, so use my tips below to ensure you will master this process from the first try! I have phyllo dough cooking tips in my full recipe on the blog. 

**a.** Thaw completely, otherwise layers will break before you touch them.

**b.** Cover all phyllo sheets except the one you currently working on with a damp kitchen towel.

**c.**  Generously brush each sheet with melted butter. Use it as the glue between layers.  

**3. WRAP BRIE IN PHYLLO DOUGH**

Simply place brie with the bottom part up in the center of phyllo layers, and start wrapping working your way around, and making sure you seal each angle. Use more butter if needed. Flip it back.

**4. ADD FIG JAM AND BAKE**

**a.** Add fig jam to the top of your wrapped brie spread carefully.  
  
**b.** Place on a baking sheet and sent it to your preheated oven for 15 minutes.

**!!!TIPS!!!**

*many recipes call for 400F right away.* ***DO NOT*** *do that, or your sealed phyllo cover might break on the top. Instead, bake for 350F for the first 15 minutes and then switch over to broiling mode on low. Keep a close eye and take brie out as soon as the jam on top will begin caramelizing.*

This chicken with creamy fennel broth is so delicious, spicy, and rich. We topped it with a fennel gremolata so no part of the fennel goes to waste!

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 55 minutes 

Servings: 4 

Calories: 765kcal

### Equipment

* Sheet pan
* Large skillet
* Large pot

### Ingredients

* 4 chicken thighs skin-on, bone-in
* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil for frying
* 8 ounces orzo
* 2 cups reserved pasta cooking water
* 1 fennel bulb with stalks and fronds
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

#### Fennel Gremolata:

* 1/2 cup fennel fronds
* 1 lemon juiced
* 3 ounces pine nuts
* 1 teaspoon fennel pollen optional
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Fry the Chicken:

* Preheat oven to 425ºF. Heat the neutral cooking oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place into the skillet and cook in batches, skin-side down, until the skin is crispy and golden (about 5 minutes).
* As the chicken finishes cooking, transfer it to a sheet pan, skin-side up. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of chicken fat and set the skillet aside.
* Place a small piece of aluminum foil in the corner of the sheet pan and add the pine nuts in an even layer.
* Transfer the sheet pan to the oven. After 5-7 minutes, remove the pine nuts and set aside.
* Continue baking the chicken for another 30 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF. Turn off the oven and leave the chicken in the warm oven until you are ready to plate the dish.

#### Cook the Orzo:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the orzo and cook until just al dente. Scoop out 2 cups of pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain and rinse the orzo.

#### Prepare the Fennel:

* Remove 1/2 cup of fennel fronds from the stalks. Pick off the remaining fronds and reserve for another use. Thinly slice the fennel stalks into rounds. Remove the core from the bulb and slice the bulb into strips. Set aside.

#### Prepare the Creamy Fennel Broth:

* Heat the skillet used to fry the chicken over medium heat. Once hot, add the fennel and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until softened and golden brown.
* Add the reserved pasta cooking water and bring to a boil. Season liberally with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 5 more minutes until reduced slightly. Slowly whisk in the heavy cream and reduce heat to low. Cook for an additional 5-6 minutes until thickened. Turn off the heat.

#### Prepare the Fennel Gremolata:

* Roughly chop the fennel fronds and toss them in a bowl with the toasted pine nuts. Add the lemon juice, salt, pepper, and fennel pollen (if using) and toss to combine. Set aside.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the orzo between shallow bowls and ladle the broth on top. Place a chicken thigh on top and garnish with the fennel gremolata. Enjoy!

### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup milk lukewarm
* 1 tbsp active dry yeast
* 3-8\* tbsp sugar use less for a savory brioche or more for a sweet brioche
* 5 large eggs room temperature
* 2 tsp vanilla extract **optional**, use if you're making a sweet brioche
* 4 1/2 cups flour all-purpose
* 1 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 1/4 cup butter unsalted, softened at room temperature, cut into 6 equal-sized pieces
* simple syrup or egg wash\*\* for a glossy top, see recipe notes for details

\*Metric measurements will be a button in the recipe card on the blog :)\*

### Instructions

#### Day 1

* Whisk the lukewarm milk, yeast, and 1 tsp of the sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. Whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract.
* Mix the salt and remaining sugar into the flour. Add the dry ingredients into the bowl of your stand mixer. Secure the dough hook to the mixer, and mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.
* Add one piece of butter to the dough. Mix on medium speed until the butter is completely blended into the dough, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Repeat this step until all the butter is completely incorporated into the dough.
* Continue to knead the dough on medium speed for 5-10 minutes, or until it's completely smooth and elastic. The dough will be soft and slightly tacky to the touch. It should pull from the sides of the bowl. It may still stick to the bottom a bit. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer it to the fridge overnight.

#### Day 2

* Remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 3 hours. Flour your work surface and hands well, Remove the dough from the bowl and form it into a ball.
* Split the ball into two equal-sized pieces. Set one of them aside and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Prep two loaf pans by generously buttering the inside, then dusting with flour.

#### Braided loaf

* Roll the dough ball into a long, thin, oval-like shape. Use a knife or a pizza cutter to slice the oval into 3 equal-sized ropes, leaving about 1 inch of dough connecting the ropes at the top.
* Roll the ropes slightly to smooth them out. Starting from the top where the dough is still connected, braid the strands of dough. Once you've reached the end, pinch the ends of the ropes together.
* Gently lift the braid into one of the prepared loaf pans, tucking the inched ends underneath. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size and reaching the top of the loaf pan.

#### Nantaise loaf

* Take the remaining dough ball and portion it into 8 equal-sized pieces. Flatten one of the pieces out, fold the edges into the middle, and pinch them together. Flip the piece over and cup your hand over it. Gently roll to create a perfect ball. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.
* Place the dough balls into the prepared loaf pan, slightly off-set to create a zig-zag pattern. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size and reaching the top of the loaf pan.

#### Bake

* While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven the 325F. Once the dough has risen, transfer the loaf pans to the oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. \***Optional:** If you are making a savory brioche, brush the tops of the loaves with egg wash before baking.
* For the sweet brioche in the photos: Brush the loaves generously with syrup immediately once you take them out of the oven. Let the loaves cool for 10 minutes, then brush with another layer of syrup. Let the loaves sit for 5 minutes, then gently flip them out of the pan to finish cooling on a rack.

### Notes

\*Use less sugar if you want a savory brioche, and use more sugar if you want a sweet brioche. I used 5 tbsp for my loaves.\*\*Use simple syrup for sweet brioche and egg wash for a savory brioche. 

* **Egg wash:** whisk 2 eggs with 2 tbsp milk to water. After the dough has risen in the loaf pans, before transferring into the oven, gently brush the egg wash over the dough.
* **Simple syrup:** Dissolve 1/2 cup granulated sugar into 1/2 cup hot water. Let the syrup cool in the fridge as the loaves bake. Brush the loaves generously with syrup immediately once you take them out of the oven. Let the loaves cool for 10 minutes, then brush with another layer of syrup."

### Ingredients

* 2 lbs boneless pork chops 4-6 chops
* 1/2 cup flour all-purpose
* 1 tbsp seasoned salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs
* vegetable oil for frying
* **Optional** lemon wedges to serve
* **Optional** parsley freshly chopped, to serve

### Instructions

* Place a pork chop between two sheets of plastic wrap or into a freezer bag. Use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to flatten the pork chop until it's about 1/4"" thick. Use sweeping motions, working from the middle to the edges of the chop, for even thickness throughout. Repeat with the remaining chops.
* Prepare three shallow plates. Whisk the flour and seasoning salt in one, beat the eggs in the second, and add the breadcrumbs to the third. Take a pork chop and dredge it through the flour, coating it completely. Shake off any excess flour.
* Then, coat the pork chop in the beaten egg. Let the excess drip off before coating it completely in the panko breadcrumbs. Dredge the remaining chops in the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs.
* Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add enough vegetable oil to completely coat the bottom of the pan. Once shimmering and hot, add the pork chops, working in batches. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown. Set the finished chops on a paper towel-lined plate. **Optional: Sprinkle flaked sea salt and freshly cracked pepper over the schnitzels before serving.**"

# Ingredients for the Kimchi:

* 700 g Cucumbers - (pickling veriety)
* 14 g Salt - (2% of cucumber weight)
* 1 Medium-sized carrot - cut into 5cm julienne
* A handful of chives

# Ingredients for the Paste:

* 3 tbsp Gochugaru - (Korean chili flakes, use 2 tbsp for a milder version)
* 1.5 tbsp Minced garlic
* 2 tsp Minced ginger
* ½ Red Apple - grated
* 1.5 tbsp Honey - or sugar
* 1 tsp Minced Saeujeot - (Korean salted shrimp) (use more fish sauce if not available)
* 1 tsp Fish sauce - (use dark soy sauce for a vegan version)

# Instructions:

1. Start by trimming the ends of the cucumbers. Slice each cucumber in half lengthwise, then cut these halves into 5cm pieces. For added texture, you can further slice each segment into a triangular prism shape.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cucumber segments with the julienned carrots and chives. Sprinkle the salt evenly over the vegetables, ensuring they are well-coated. This salting process draws out moisture, which is crucial for fermentation. Let the mixture rest for about **25 minutes**.
3. While the cucumbers are resting, prepare the spicy Gochugaru paste. In a separate bowl, mix the Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes), minced garlic, minced ginger, grated red apple, sugar or honey, minced Saeujeot (Korean salted shrimp), and fish sauce. Adjust the chili flakes if you prefer a milder taste. Stir until you achieve a consistent paste.
4. After the cucumbers have rested, gently squeeze out any excess moisture. Add the Gochugaru paste to the cucumber mixture, ensuring all pieces are evenly coated. Now, it's time to pack! You can use a traditional jar or opt for vacuum bags. Make sure to remove as much air as possible to promote proper fermentation.
5. Allow the packed kimchi to ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 days. You'll notice a slight tangy aroma, indicating the fermentation process is underway.After this period, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator to halt fermentation and preserve the cucumber's crunch. While the cucumber kimchi is ready to enjoy immediately after chilling, its flavors will continue to develop over the next few days. Since cucumbers are more delicate than cabbage, it’s best to consume this kimchi while it retains its crispiness.

*Nashville's hot chicken is to-die-for, with a crispy, fried crust and a spicy oil infused with cayenne pepper and paprika for that extra kick. It's a local speciality of Nashville, TN, typically made by marinating the chicken in buttermilk, flouring, and frying it until its crispy and golden; it is then served with a special oil sauce that really brings the heat!* 

Recipe #21

**Nashville Chicken Burger**

Serves: 2 | Cooking Time: 20 minutes | Spice Profile: High

https://youtu.be/6RbZfkyU1n4 

**Ingredients**

&#x200B;

* 2 chicken breasts,      butterflied and flattened
* For the marinade: 1/4 cup      buttermilk (1), 1 tbsp hot sauce (2), 1 egg
* For the coating: 1 tbsp      freshly ground pepper, 1 tbsp salt, 2 tsps chilli powder, 1/4 cup      breadcrumbs (optional), 1/2 cup flour
* Oil, about 1/4 cup, for      frying (3)
* For the Nashville Spicy Oil:      3:2:1:1 ratio of chilli powder/cayenne pepper, brown sugar, paprika      powder, and garlic powder, with added oil to make into, well, oil.
* Pickles and buns, to serve.

**Method**

&#x200B;

* Mix together the buttermilk,      hot sauce, and egg in a bowl. (4)
* Add the pepper, salt, chilli      powder, flour, and (if using) breadcrumbs in another bowl.
* Make sure your chicken is      flat or, at the very least, consistently even, and dip it in the      buttermilk mixture, followed by a dip in the flour mixture. Repeat this      step. (5)
* Heat a pan and add enough      oil to cover the base of the pan. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and      cook until golden–brown on both sides.
* In the meantime, mix the      Nashville Spicy Oil ingredients together. (6)
* Once the chicken is cooked,      let it rest on a grill or some paper to get rid of any excess oil, and      then serve hot with pickles.

**Helpful Tips & Notes**

(1) There's a really simply way to make buttermilk, if you don't have any at home. For every cup of milk, add 1 tbsp of lemon and let sit for 15 minutes. The acid in the lemon causes the milk to curdle, giving you buttermilk. Also, for those of you familiar with [a different form of buttermilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaas), this isn't *chaas*.

(2) I used Tabasco's hot sauce, but the milder, ""with garlic"" one. Just wanted to let you know, in case you were curious.

(3) Make sure there's enough to cover the bottom of the pan at a height of about two centimetres; it'll be enough to cook evenly a side of the chicken.

(4) Now, there are many variations to this, and I'm definitely not touting mine to be the most authentic. It is well-known that yogurt denatures the proteins in chicken and makes it softer and easier to cook. In *ye olden days* (and also now), most Nashville chicken is marinated in a buttermilk mixture before cooking.

(5) Double dipping allows for a neat, unified coating of the flour onto the chicken. I added breadcrumbs to give a bit more crunch to the outside; you can ignore that if that's not your thing. Furthermore, you can leave the chicken in the fridge for up to 10 (or 15) minutes to help maintain the consistency of the flour coating.

(6) This was honestly an interesting flavour, with the brown sugar at the forefront and the burn of the chilli powder at the base of my throat. If you're feeling lucky, you can turn up the chilli powder at the expense of the brown sugar and just go to town.

Keep your eye on the sauce as you don’t want it to stick to the pan.
* Throw the baked tofu in the sauce and coat generously. Toss lightly so it’s all covered.
* Serve with white rice and top with some chopped scallions and white sesame seeds.

## Notes

Remember, the key to crispy and flavorful tofu is to drain and press your tofu. You want to squeeze as much liquid out as possible.

[Traditional Swedish meatballs](https://theswedishfood.com/swedish-meatballs/traditional-swedish-meatballs/)

Meatballs the traditional way. Served with mashed potatoes and pickled cucumbers. You may also add some cream sauce and lingonberry jam. I hope you enjoy. =)


Ingredients for meatballs

* 1 onion
* 0.5 cup milk
* 0.5 cup breadcrumbs mix
* 1 egg
* 2 tbsp beef stock
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp butter
* 1 lb minced meat
* 0.5 tsp salt
* 2 dashes black pepper
* 2 dashes allspice, ground

But hold on, mister. What kind of meat should I choose for meatballs? Good question my dear fellow human being. If you want juicy meatballs you should go 50/50 or 70/30 with beef/pork ratio. You could go 100% either way. If you’re going with 100% beef you HAVE to use breadcrumb, milk and/or cooking cream in the mixture to make it juicy. 100% pork, well, that will become incredibly fatty. This recipe is made with 100% beef.




Ingredients for mashed potatoes

* 2 lb potatoes
* 1 cup of milk
* 3 tbsp cooking cream
* 1 dash of salt
* 1 dash of black pepper



Ingredients for pickled cucumber

* 1 cucumber
* 1 cup water
* 10 tbsp sugar
* 10 tbsp white vinegar 12%



How-to:

Start with the pickled cucumber. It has to sit for an hour before it’s ready. While the pickled cucumber is on hold, you can start preparing for the main dish. As well as the mashed potatoes.

* Cut the cucumber into thin slices.
* Bring the water, white vinegar, and sugar to a boil.
* Let it cool, then pour it on top of the cucumber.
* Let it rest for one hour.



Continue with the mashed potatoes.

* Peel and dice the potatoes into even pieces. This will decrease the amount of time needed to be boiled.
* Boil potatoes until soft all the way through. 10-15 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes.
* Mash the potatoes. This is most efficiently done with a potato press.
* Heat up cooking cream with milk. Add to the mashed potatoes.



During the boiling of the potatoes, it’s a good idea to start with the meatballs.

* Peel and mince onion. Fry in 2 tbsp of butter until soft.
* Mix breadcrumbs, milk, beef stock, mustard, and egg. Let swell for 5 min.
* Add the minced meat and onion together with all the spices.
* Evenly mix it all together.
* Roll into medium-large meatballs. Fry in remaining butter and oil for 5-6 min.



Cream sauce (optional)

Bring 1 and a quarter cup of cooking cream, 2 tbsp of beef stock, and 1 tsp of soy sauce to a boil. While boiling, add and stir 1 tbsp of corn starch.

Boil while stirring for 5 minutes. If the sauce is too thin, add some corn starch. Too thick, add some cream. Finnish it by seasoning with salt and pepper.



Tips for making good meatballs

* Don’t handle the meat excessively. Neither when mixing the meat nor when rolling the meat into meatballs. This squeezes out fat resulting in dryer meatballs.
* Roll meatballs with oily/buttery hands. It makes it easier.

There you go! Serve it with a side dish of lingonberry jam and you will have a complete meal! Smaklig måltid"

* once the butter is well melted put it in the savoiardi's crumbs, add 50 gr ( 1.76 ounce ) of coffee too and mix well
* Press  the mixture into the bottom of an 20 cm (8 inch) springform pan, you  can put a cake collar in it now. Chill in fridge until firm, normally 40  minutes.

\----------- How to Mascarpone  Cream  ---------------

* separate the egg yolks from the egg whites
* put the gelatin in abundant water for at least 10 minutes until is soft
* in  a mixing bowl put the yolk and begin to work it with an electric whisk  if you are not sure of the freshness and quality of the eggs you can  always pasteurize the eggs ( see\*)
* add 1/2 of sugar at the time and let the yolks absorb it
* work the yolks until they change color
* add the mascarpone a little at the time beating with an electric whisk until it becomes smooth.
* Repeat the operation with the cream cheese
* put  the heavy cream in a saucepan, warm it on low heat and put the gelatin  well drained from the water. Mix until the gelatin is well melted in the  heavy cream
* Add the heavy cream at the mixture a little at the time and continue to beat until the batter is creamy and smooth

\------------ Assembly-------------------------

* Cut the remaining savoiardi in half
* take the springform pan from the fridge and pour half of the cream cheese mixture
* Soak  the savoiardi in the cold coffee for a few moments and distributed it  on the cream pressing gently until you obtain a layer  pour another  quarter of the cream.
* can  happen that the savoiardi will rise a little, don't panic. Put the cake  in the fridge  for 20 minutes then press a little the savoiardi in the  cream.
* Finally cover with the remaining cream cheese mixture  put the springform pan in fridge for at least 3 hour.

\*To pasteurize egg  yolks. Whip them with 65 gr sugar while you prepare the syrup with  another 65 gr sugar and 45 gr of water. Wait for the syrup to reach 120°  C. ( 248°F), then pour it very slowly over the whipped yolks, mixing  the syrup well with the yolks if you have a stand mixer and a food  thermometer the operation it's pretty easy

### Ingredients

* 4 New England Style buns top split
* 5 tablespoons room temperature unsalted butter divided
* 4 teaspoons mayo divided
* 1 pound cooked and shelled lobster meat
* Kosher salt to taste
* ½ tablespoon dried oregano or dried tarragon
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
* ½ fresh lemon

### Instructions

1. Preheat a skillet to medium low heat.
2. Divide 2 tablespoons of butter into 4 pieces. Split each piece in half and spread evely on each side of the buns.
3. Toast the buns on both sides for 2-3 minutes until lightly toasted.
4. While the buns are toasting, quickly chop up the chives and cut up lemon. Set aside.
5. After the buns are toasted, immediately spread a thin layer of mayo inside each of the buns. Set aside the buns.
6. Chop up already cooked and shelled lobster meat to bite sized pieces.
7. Set a light colored medium saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining butter (about 3 tablespoonto the saucepan and allow to melt.
8. Continuously swirl butter while the butter changes from pale yellow to tan to a golden brown. Once it’s golden brown, reduce the heat to medium low and carefully add chopped lobster meat. Stir until coated and warmed through (about 1 minute). Salt lightly.
9. Working quickly, divide lobster between toasted buns.
10. Sprinkle with oregano or tarragon and a light drizzle of lemon juice. Finish with freshly chopped chives.
11. Enjoy immediately.

### Notes

* Mise en place is important in this recipe. Prep and toast your buns, chop your chives and cut your lemons before you start to brown the butter and warm up the lobster.
* Use a good quality butter if possible, I like Kerrygold unsalted butter.
* Top split buns are preferable but use what you can find.
* If you can’t use find lobster, crab meat would be a nice substitute."

4. Heat 2 tbsp of butter in a pan. Add black and green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and bay leaf and cook until fragrant.
5. Add ginger and garlic pastes and fry for a couple of min. until the raw smell disappears. 
6. Add tomato puree, green chillies and red chili powder and cook until most of the water from the tomatoes has evaporated and the oils start to separate. 
7. Add around a cup of water (add more or less depending on how thick you want the sauce to be), and the chicken and simmer for about 10 min.

* Cook on medium heat until they're translucent, add the garlic and chopped chilli, cook for a minute or two until they soften. 
* Add tomatoes, cook down until they soften, as it starts absorbing the water, add a tablespoon or two of the pasta water to begin creating a sauce.
* After a few minutes of cooking, add your spinach and continue cooking for a few more, adding small amounts of the pasta water to maintain a saucy consistency.

**FINISH IT UP**

* Once pasta is cooked, drain the remaining water and put your pasta aside. 
* After a few minutes your spinach will be cooked down and no longer look like chopped leaves, add your pasta and stir the entire lot together.

Prep 15 mins / Chilling Time 1 hr / Total time 1 hr 15 min / Servings 12 peanut butter cups

INGREDIENTS 

* 1 c creamy peanut butter
* 1/2 c + 2 Tbsp powdered sugar
* 2 c chocolate (any kind you like – I like to mix semi-sweet and milk chocolate in a 50/50 mixture)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Place chocolate in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, then stir. Continue microwaving in 15-second increments, then stirring, until the chocolate is melted and smooth.
* In a separate bowl, warm up peanut butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. Then stir in the powdered sugar until smooth. It shouldn’t be very sticky anymore and you should be able to press it between your fingers and it holds together.
* Using a teaspoon (the one from the silverware drawer), scoop up a bit of the melted chocolate and drip it into the cupcake liners. Using the tip of the spoon, gently nudge it to the edge of the liner, so the entire bottom is covered in a thin layer of chocolate.
* Next, scoop up a small bit of the peanut butter mixture and roll it into a 1″ ball. Press the ball flat between the palms of your hands to form a disc.
* Place this disc of peanut butter on top of the chocolate layer in the cupcake pan.
* Finally, using a teaspoon again, scoop up some more of the melted chocolate and drizzle it over top of the peanut butter in a thin layer. Again, using the tip of the spoon, gently nudge it around so that it drips down all sides of the peanut butter.
* Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to chill.

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18yoc98,https://i.redd.it/yhqkd2g6qhac1.jpeg,reddit,"Beef Wellington via Serious Eats

Ingredients:

* 1 center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed of silverskin and fat, about 2 pounds

* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

* 2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon vegetable or canola oil, divided

* 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 tablespoon Dijon, spicy brown, or hot English mustard

* 1 pound mushrooms (button, cremini, shiitake, portabello, or a mix) cleaned, trimmed, and roughly chopped

* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter

* 2 medium shallots, finely diced (about 1/2 cup)

* 2 teaspoons finely minced fresh thyme leaves

* 1/2 cup Cognac or other brandy or barrel-aged spirit, such as bourbon

* 1/2 cup heavy cream

* 2 teaspoons soy sauce

* 4 ounces fresh foie gras (about two 1/2-inch slabs, see note)

* 1 sheet phyllo dough

* 1/4 pound prosciutto, sliced paper thin

* Flour, for dusting

* 14 ounces frozen or homemade puff pastry, thawed (see note)

* 1 egg, beaten

* Coarse sea salt, such as Maldon or fleur de sel

* 1 bunch finely minced chives


Directions:

1. Using butcher's twine, tie tenderloin at 1-inch intervals. Trim ends of twine. Season liberally with salt and pepper.

2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until smoking. Add tenderloin and cook without moving until well-browned on first side, about 2 minutes. Rotate tenderloin and continue cooking until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a large plate.

3. Combine horseradish, mustard, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl. When tenderloin is cool enough to handle, cut off and discard twine, then rub on all surfaces with horseradish/mustard mixture. Place in refrigerator, uncovered.

4. Place half the mushrooms in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until very finely chopped, scraping down sides and redistributing mushrooms with spatula as necessary, about 10 short pulses. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with remaining mushrooms.

5. Heat butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have exuded all their liquid and start to sizzle, about 8 minutes. Continue cooking until mushrooms begin to brown and leave browned bits stuck to bottom of pan, about 4 minutes longer. Add shallots and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 2 minutes.

6. Add brandy. Scrape bottom of skillet with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to release browned bits. Continue to cook until brandy is nearly dry, about 4 minutes. Add heavy cream and soy sauce and continue to cook, stirring frequently until mixture is thick and collects in one large mass when you shake the skillet. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and place in the refrigerator.

7. Season foie gras liberally with salt and pepper. Heat remaining half teaspoon oil in a small cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until smoking. Add foie gras and cook without moving until well browned on first side, about 30 seconds. Carefully flip with a small offset spatula and brown second side, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer foie gras to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour rendered fat into mushroom mixture, stir to combine, and return to refrigerator. Use a sharp knife to split each piece of cooked foie gras in half horizontally. Transfer to a plate and place in refrigerator. Allow all ingredients to chill for at least 30 minutes.

8. Lay a double layer of plastic wrap about 2 feet long and 1 foot wide on a cutting board. Lay phyllo dough on top of plastic wrap. Shingle prosciutto on top of phyllo to create a thin, even, overlapping layer, leaving a 2-inch border along the bottom and top of the phyllo dough. Spread mushroom mixture evenly over ham layer.

9. Place tenderloin along the very bottom edge of the ham/mushroom layer. Place sliced foie gras evenly over top of tenderloin (see note). Carefully roll tenderloin in mushroom, ham, and phyllo, using the plastic wrap to help tighten it as you roll. Once beef is completely rolled up, re-wrap with more plastic wrap, twisting the ends to make sure roll is very tight. Return to refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

10. Dust board or countertop lightly with flour. Spread puff pastry on board and, using a rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle at least 4 inches wider than the beef roll on its shorter side.

11. Unwrap beef roll and place along very bottom edge of puff pastry with the foie gras side facing up. Brush 6 inches of puff pastry just above beef roll with beaten egg. Carefully roll the beef in the puff pastry until it is completely wrapped. You should end up with the foie gras-side facing up again, with the puff pastry seam meeting on the bottom. Trim pastry with a sharp knife.

12. Fold sides of puff pastry protruding from either end of the beef roll towards the center, then fold the top flaps down. Trim off the bottom flaps carefully.

13. Roll entire beef roll over so that the bottom is facing up, then fold up the end flaps to seal completely. Roll beef back right-side up. Transfer to a plate and chill for at least 30 minutes.

14. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Transfer Wellington to a foil-lined baking sheet and brush all over with beaten egg. Use a sharp paring knife to score a decorative pattern in the pastry. Sprinkle liberally with coarse sea salt. Bake until pastry is golden brown and center of roast registers 110°F (43°C) for rare or 120°F (49°C) for medium-rare on an instant-read thermometer, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest for ten minutes.

15. Use a thin metal spatula to loosen Wellington from foil, then carefully transfer to a carving board. Slice off the ends with a sharp knife. Carve Wellington, sprinkle cut surfaces with chives and more coarse salt, and serve."

# Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 teaspoon sugar optional
* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 3 teaspoons fruit preserves of your choice (recommend apricot, prune, fig, blackberry)
* 1 cup white rice uncooked
* 1 small head savoy cabbage trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced
* 10 cups water or chicken stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For serving:

* Fresh dill
* Sour cream

## Instructions

## Caramelize the onions:

* Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, melt the butter and add the onions. Cook, stirring regularly, for 15 minutes until they soften and the edges begin to darken.
* If desired, sprinkle with sugar to help speed up the caramelizing process. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 15–20 minutes until the onions are deep, golden-brown, and well-caramelized. Remove them from the pot and set them aside.

## Brown the beef:

* If the pot seems dry, add another teaspoon of oil. Turn the heat to medium-high and add the ground beef. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, for 15–20 minutes until well-browned and thoroughly cooked through. Season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and thyme. Add the fruit preserves and stir to incorporate. Cook an additional 1–2 minutes.

## Simmer the soup:

* Add the white rice, reserved caramelized onions, and the thinly sliced cabbage to the pot. Season the cabbage with a few shakes of salt. Pour the water or stock over and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir the soup occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking.

## Finish the soup:

* Remove the lid from the pot, taste the soup, and season to your preferences. Simmer an additional 10 minutes, uncovered. If the soup is too thick, add another splash of water or stock to the pot.

## To serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh dill or parsley. If you like, serve with a dollop of sour cream. Enjoy!

Easily prepared and loaded with aromatic flavors of basil, these basil-parmesan chicken meatballs are the perfect accent to pasta or enjoyed on their own.


###Grade
Makes: About 15 meatballs

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 45 minutes (20 minutes inactive)

###Ingredients for Basil-Parmesan Chicken Meatballs

1 pound ground chicken

1 cup fresh basil leaves

½ cup breadcrumbs

⅓ cup shredded parmesan cheese

½ head of garlic

Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste 

1 tablespoon cooking oil

Extra virgin olive and more fresh basil, optional, for serving

###Method

**Prepare Ingredients:**
Preheat oven to 400ºF. Roll the basil leaves into a tight bundle and thinly slice into ribbons to create a chiffonade of basil. Peel and mince all the garlic.

**Prepare the Meatballs:**
In a bowl, combine the ground chicken, basil leaves, garlic, breadcrumbs, parmesan and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. (If desired, fry a small piece of the meatball mixture to ensure that it is seasoned correctly.)

Gently combine the mixture in the bowl with your hands without over-mixing. Form the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls and roll lightly. Do not over-roll the meatballs; they should be a bit ragged. Transfer the meatballs to a plate.

**Cook the Meatballs:**
In a large, ovenproof skillet, heat the 1 tablespoon cooking oil until over medium heat until hot. Add the meatballs in an even layer and cook for about 2 minutes per side until lightly browned all over. 

Transfer to the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the meatballs are completely cooked through, turning once midway through cooking.

**To Serve:**
If serving as an appetizer, arrange the meatballs on a bed of fresh basil leaves and drizzle with a touch of extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy!"

# Ingredients

* Regular ‘ole chicken breast
* All purpose flour
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* Capers in brine
* Dry white wine (ex. chardonnay)
* Shallots / onion
* Garlic
* Fresh parsley
* Butter

# Method

**1)** Butterfly your chicken breast. With your knife parallel to the cutting board, slowly slice the breast in half longways. You definitely need a sharp knife and some finesse for this, but it is worth it. You want a nice, thin section of meat so you can maximize your crispy breading-to-meat ratio.

**2)** Pound out your butterflied chicken. Don’t get it tooo thin, but you want a nice, even 1/2 inch thick cutlet.

**3)** Season your meat with salt. A nice hefty pinch on both sides should do. Let that hang out while you cut your veg.

**4)** Finely dice shallots and garlic. I’d say half a shallot and 1 small garlic clove per chicken cutlet. 

**5)** Mix flour with some salt and lightly coat your chicken. Generally, you want to season any batter/coating that you plan to fry with. 

**6)** Heat olive oil in pan on medium-high heat, enough to shallow fry the chicken.

**7)** Fry chicken until golden brown on both sides and interior is fully cooked, about 2-3 minutes a side, depending on the thickness of the cutlet. 

**8)** Remove chicken from the pan, pour out most of the oil, turn down the heat and add shallots, garlic and capers.

**9)** Once your aromatics are softened, crank the heat again and pour in a splash of wine to deglaze the pan. Try to scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pan.

**10)** After your wine has reduced to a shallow, viscous, pool of bubbling flavor, add in 2 tablespoon of cold butter… maybe even more. You will feel guilty about this, but your just gonna have to fight through it and put it all in. A tidbit about butter sauces: butter is awesome (duh). It is a combo of delicious fat and milk proteins that, under normal circumstances, separate when heated. The ideal pan sauce is homogeneous, or without fat separation. To achieve this, we need to *emulsify* the fat into our sauce. Luckily for us, there are already a few factors helping us achieve this. Both the starch in the flour and the sugar from the wine amps up the viscosity of the liquid, ultimately creating an environment that makes emulsification fairly easy. IN SHORT: you want to let your butter melt, bubble, and mix with your wine reduction until that fat is fully emulsified. This takes some practice to get the timing right, but you generally know you’ve succeeded if you can get the sauce to coat the back of a spoon. 

**11)** Squeeze a bit of lemon and throw in a few slices if you’d like. Also, add a whole bunch of fresh parsley for freshness and color. Season to taste with salt. I actually think black pepper has no place in this recipe. 

**12)** Pour over your chicken and devour. Pasta is a pretty common accompaniment with piccata, but I advise against tossing it with your sauce. The stuff is liquid gold if you did it right, and you likely won’t have too much… It’s just the nature of a pan sauce. In my opinion, all of that should go right on the chicken for the most enjoyable experience. Pasta or not… enjoy."

**Step by step:** [**Marry Me Chicken**](https://chefsbinge.com/marry-me-chicken/)

&#x200B;

**Ingredients for Marry Me Chicken:**

\* 3 medium-sized chicken breasts, each breast sliced into cutlets

\* 100g (3.5oz) of plain flour (in the bowl)

\* 10 cherry tomatoes, sliced in half

\* 150g (5.3oz) of sun-dried tomatoes, finely diced

\* 2tbsp of olive oil (you can use oil from sun-dried tomatoes)

\* 30g (1oz) of butter

\* 4 garlic cloves, finely diced

\* 200ml (0.21quarts) of veg stock

\* 300ml (0.31quarts) of heavy cream

\* 30g (1oz) of grated parmesan cheese (plus 10g more for garnish)

\* 1tsp tomato paste

\* 1tbsp oregano

\* fresh basil, a few leaves for garnish

\* salt & black pepper to taste

\* 1tsp of chilli flakes (optional)

&#x200B;

**How to prepare Marry Me Chicken:**

**1.** Preheat the oven to 140C (284F) and place sliced cherry tomatoes on the tray, drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Slow-roast for 45 minutes.

**2.** Season sliced chicken breast with a little bit of salt and coat them in plain flour. Transfer them to a plate but do not stack as they will stick together.

**3.** Preheat the frying pan and add olive oil and butter. Once butter melts, pan-fry chicken breasts on medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown (I had to do it in three batches). When ready transfer the chicken onto a plate. Keep covered with another plate and set aside.

**4.** Sauté the diced garlic for a minute and add veg stock, give it a stir to remove any bits stuck to a pan. Next, add heavy cream and parmesan cheese. Simmer for 2 minutes then mix in 1tsp of tomato puree, season with oregano and chilli.

**5.** Add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and the chicken, simmer for a few minutes or until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.

**6.** Garnish with semi-dried cherry tomatoes, fresh basil leaves and sprinkle with parmesan. Enjoy with pasta, rice or pearl barley."

Thanks so much to u/love2bakecakes , the original recipe is [Alison Roman's Tiny Salty Chocolaty Cookies](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020520-tiny-salty-chocolaty-cookies). I must have added the cinnamon and espresso and omitted the nuts, which must have thrown off my search. Appreciate y'all!

salted brownie cookies:

* 6 tbsp unsalted butter
* 2.5 cups confectioners sugar

* 1 tsp espresso powder
* 8 oz semisweet chocolate, chopped
* flaky sea salt for topping (optional)

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Melt the butter in a small pot over medium heat, swirling, until it's starting to foam and brown, 3 to 4 minutes. (Whisk the butter from time to time so that the solids don’t stick to the bottom of the pot.) Let cool.
3. Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, spices (cinnamon and espresso powder) and salt in a medium bowl, ridding it of as many lumps as possible.
4. Using a spatula, mix in the egg whites, whole egg and browned butter, stirring until you’ve got a good, smoothish mixture (any small lumps will take care of themselves), followed by the chocolate.
5. Using a spoon, drop silver dollar size blobs of dough (the texture is really somewhere between a dough and a batter) onto the baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart (they spread a lot).
6. Sprinkle with flaky salt and bake until the cookies have flattened considerably and look baked through and a little wrinkled, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool before eating so they can firm up."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1ffax6j,https://i.redd.it/x4lfz7y0ifod1.jpeg,reddit,"# Ingredients:

* Ready-made puff pastry — 400 g (14 ounces)
* Apple — 3 pcs (use juicy, crunchy, sweet apples!)
* Cinnamon — ½ tsp
* Cane sugar — 4 tbsp
* Cornstarch — 1 tsp
* Water — 1 tbsp
* Egg yolk — 1 pcs

# How to cook:

1. Defrost the puff pastry beforehand. Wash and dice the apples.
2. Place the apples in a saucepan with 3 tablespoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of cinnamon.
3. Place the pan over medium heat and cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved. Stir the cornstarch into a small amount of cold water until smooth and add to the apples.
4. Stir well and cook the apples for a few minutes until the juice has thickened (the whole mixture should be sticky). Then remove from the heat and let the apples rest.
5. Sprinkle the thawed dough with a little flour and roll out to about 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) thick. Then cut out circles (I used a glass and a knife to do this).I had 2 sheets of ready-made puff pastry which made 16 circles (I also used the leftover dough after cutting). It is important that you get an even number of dough circles.
6. Make small snowflake-shaped cuts on half of the dough circles (watch how I do it in the video).
7. Spread 1 tablespoon of the apple filling on each of the remaining circles (the ones without the cuts). Cover with a circle of the scored dough, pressing the edges together a little with your fingers and then running a fork around the circle to create a nice scalloped edge.
8. Brush the puffs with egg yolk and sprinkle with a little cane sugar (this will make the crust more golden).
9. Put the puffs in a preheated oven at 175°C (350°F) for 15-20 minutes (convection mode). After that, take the puffs out of the oven and let them cool down. Enjoy!

**Ingredients**

* 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
* 1 cup dark brown sugar packed
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs cold
* ½ tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* 1 cup chocolate chips I like semisweet
* Finishing flake salt optional

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 350℉. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder until well combined.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, add butter. Butter will melt and then brown in 5-15 minutes (very dependent on the brand of butter so watch carefully). Once you start to smell and see brown butter begin to form, swirl the butter around in the pan for even browning. Brown butter is ready when it’s nut/mahogany brown.
3. Immediately pour the butter into a large heat-safe bowl, scraping down the pan to scoop out any brown bits. Add the granulated and dark brown sugars. Stir.
4. Let brown butter and sugar mixture cool for 10 minutes.
5. Add cold eggs and vanilla extract. Mix well.
6. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Stir until just combined.
7. Fold in chocolate chips. Dough will be very soft and malleable.
8. While you can chill your dough for up to an hour, there is absolutely no need to (I actually like the cookies just as much or more without chilling the dough). Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized balls on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Tip: keep bowl with dough in the fridge between batches.
9. Bake cookies for 10-14 minutes until they are just set in the middle and light golden around the edges. Don’t over-bake!
10. Sprinkle with flake salt if desired. Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely or enjoying warm! Repeat for other batches."

This homemade pappardelle pasta with meat ragu is a labor of love, but it’s a wonderful project for a rainy Sunday.

# Grade:

Serves: 5

Cost: $7.19 per serving (less if using chuck roast instead of short ribs)

Skill Level: Intermediate

Time to Make: This is a full day, off and on

# Ingredients for Homemade Pappardelle Pasta with Meat Ragu

**Pappardelle Pasta:**

2 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon salt

3 eggs

3 egg yolks

6 tablespoons water, plus more if needed

**Meat Ragu:**

3 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 3 pieces

2 pounds bone-in beef short ribs

Oil, for frying

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

4 carrots, peeled and small-diced

4 stalks celery, trimmed and small-diced

1/4 cup garlic confit (or 5-6 cloves fresh garlic, minced)

8 ounces cremini mushrooms

1 cup red wine (or beef stock)

3-4 cups beef stock, plus more as needed

2 14.5-ounce cans fire-roasted crushed tomatoes

1/2 teaspoon dry thyme

Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

# Method

**Start the Meat Ragu:**

1. Pat all the meat dry and season liberally with salt and pepper. Heat a slick of oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the meat, in batches and without crowding the pan, and cook for 5-7 minutes per side until well-browned all over. Transfer to a plate and continue browning the rest of the meat.

**Cook the Aromatics:**

1. In a food processor, combine the mushrooms with the garlic confit and blend until finely chopped.
2. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon fat in the pot, reserving fond and return the heat to medium on the pot. Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 6-7 minutes until beginning to soften.
3. Add the puréed mushroom mixture and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, for an additional 8-10 minutes until all the aromatics are well-browned and beginning to soften.

**Cook the Ragu:**

1. Pour in the red wine and scrape up the browned bits stuck to the bottom. Bring to a boil and add the beef stock and crushed tomatoes. Taste and season with salt, pepper, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil and then add the meat and any juices from the bowl to the pot.
2. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 3-4 hours, stirring occasionally and adding more stock as necessary if the ragu reduces too much.

**Finish the Ragu:**

1. Remove the meat from the sauce and shred, discarding any large pieces of fat. Return the shredded meat to the pot and simmer, uncovered, for another 30 minutes. Taste and season to your preferences.

**Prepare the Pappardelle Dough:**

1. While the ragu is simmering, prepare the pappardelle pasta.
2. In a food processor, combine the flour and salt and pulse until blended.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolks, and water and whisk with a fork until fully combined.
4. As the food processor is running, pour the eggs into the flour and pulse until a sticky dough is formed. You may need to add more water, a splash at a time, if the dough is too dry and crumbly.

**Knead the Dough:**

1. Pour the dough onto a clean, floured surface and knead, adding more flour as necessary, for 8-10 minutes until the dough is no longer sticky.
2. Roll the dough into a ball and wrap with plastic wrap. Transfer to the refrigerator for 45 minutes to rest.

**Roll the Pasta:**

1. Set up the manual pasta machine at the widest setting. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Using your hands or a rolling pin, shape a piece of the dough into a rectangle and flatten it a bit.
2. Run the dough through the machine set to ‘0’. Flour the dough liberally on both sides and fold in half and run it through ‘0’ again. Unfold the dough and flour again, if it feels sticky. Turn the machine to ‘1’ or ‘2’ and run the dough through again.
3. Continue on, increasing the tightness of the roller, until you reach ‘6’ on the machine and the dough is about 26-30” long and you can see your fingers through it. You will make about 5-6 passes through the machine and you should flour the dough regularly to ensure that it doesn’t become sticky.
4. After the dough has been run through at ‘6’, lay it flat and cut into 1″ wide ribbons. You may wish to cut the ribbons in half if you’d like your pappardelle to be shorter.
5. Transfer the ribbons to a sheet pan to dry, flouring them as necessary to prevent them from sticking.
6. Continue on with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and allow all the dough to rest for 10-15 minutes on the sheet pan.

**Cook the Pasta:**

1. When you are ready to serve dinner, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pappardelle pasta until al dente, about 1-3 minutes. Reserve 1/3 cup of the pasta cooking water before you drain the pasta.
2. Add the reserved pasta cooking water to the simmering ragu and toss the cooked pappardelle with the sauce. Turn off the heat.

**To Serve:**

1. Divide the pasta and ragu between bowls and garnish with parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy!"

Basically eggplant parm without the carbs of breaded eggplant or pasta. I make it for lunches, it reheats well and smells incredible. 

&#x200B;

 

### Ingredients

* 1 whole eggplant
* 6 tablespoons olive oil divided
* 3 teaspoons dried italian seasoning
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* Kosher salt to taste
* ¾ – 1 cup portobello mushrooms
* 2 italian turkey sausage links
* 1 tablespoon garlic paste or 2 minced garlic cloves
* ⅔ – 1 cup marinara sauce
* ¼ cup cubed fontina cheese
* ¼ cup freshly grated provolone
* ¼ cup freshly grated parmigiano reggiano
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley chopped

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 F.
2. Chop off the stem end of the eggplant and then cut in half lengthwise. Ensure the eggplant halves are equal in size to help with even cooking.
3. Using a spoon, scoop out the meaty flesh of the eggplant, ensuring to leave about ¼ – ½ inch of the flesh and the skin intact. You’re aiming for a hollow boat of eggplant to stuff the mixture into. In a small bowl, place the scooped out eggplant and set aside.
4. Place the eggplant halves in a glass pan (9×13 works well, but any pan will do as long as the halves are in a single layer).
5. Working quickly, with the flesh side up, brush 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil on flesh of each eggplant half. The oil will absorb into the flesh quickly but ensure all the flesh is coated.
6. Sprinkle the eggplant halves with the italian seasoning until well seasoned. Next add the garlic powder and kosher salt.
7. Place the pan in the oven and roast for 40-45 minutes, or until the eggplant is fork tender.
8. While the eggplant is roasting in the oven, place a medium skillet (I prefer cast iron) on medium heat.
9. While the skillet is heating, chop the mushrooms and eggplant flesh into bite sized pieces.
10. Once the skillet is heated, add the remaining olive oil. Stir in mushrooms and eggplant flesh pieces.
11. Occasionally stir the mushrooms and eggplant until starting to brown (about 10 minutes).
12. Once the vegetables are starting to brown, remove the sausage from the casing and crumble it into the pan. Continue to stir until sausage is browned and fully cooked.
13. Add the garlic paste or cloves to the pan. Taste the mixture and add additional italian seasoning and kosher salt as needed. The mixture should be flavorful.
14. Remove the pan from the heat until the eggplant is done cooking.
15. Once the eggplant halves are fork tender (a fork should easily pierce the flesh with no resistance), toss the marinara sauce and fontina cheese together with the eggplant and mushroom mixture.

**EQUIPMENT**  
Culinary torch  
4 ounce ramekins

  
**INGREDIENTS**    
2 c heavy cream  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
5 large egg yolks  
10 Tbsp granulated sugar  
Pinch of salt  
Extra sugar for topping

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**   
\-Heat the oven to 325°F and start a kettle of water on the stove.  
\-In a pot, over low-medium heat, warm up the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt, just until hot, stirring occasionally.  
\-In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until smooth.  
\-Once the cream mixture is hot, remove from heat. Ladle out 1/2 c and slowly pour it into the egg mixture, whisking continuously (this will temper the eggs so they don’t scramble).  
\-Next, slowly pour this egg-cream mixture into the pot of cream, also whisking continuously, until smooth.  
\-Place the ramekins in a baking dish with deep sides and fill each cup to about 3/4 full with the custard mixture.  
\-At this point, your kettle of water should be boiling and the oven temperature should be ready. Pour the very hot water from the kettle into the baking dish, to about halfway up the sides of the ramekins, being careful not to spill any water into the ramekins themselves.  
\-Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the custard is still a little jiggly in the center.  
\-Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.  
\-Once the ramekins are cool enough to handle, carefully remove them from the baking pan (be careful, the water may still be quite hot!) and chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours.  
\-Just before serving, sprinkle 1 tsp of sugar on top of each one and turn on the torch. Holding the torch a few inches away, repeatedly pass it over the surface of each custard.   
\-Let cool for a few minutes, serve, and enjoy! When you break the brûléed caramelized top with a spoon, it should make a satisfying “crack”."

These are poke bowl style, but use seasoned sushi rice as the base. If you would rather make this as a poke bowl, skip the sushi rice section and just use plain white rice. You can easily customize these with whatever extra toppings you like.

**Original Recipe**: [https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/](https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/)

**Time:** 50 mins

**Servings:** 2 XL bowls (as pictured) or 3-4 smaller servings

**Ingredients**

*For Sushi Rice:*

* 1 1/2 cups medium grain sushi rice
* 1 3/4 cups warm water
* 6 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *(This should have no calories. If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)*
* 2 tbsp white sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp table salt

*For Sesame Salmon:*

* 6-10 oz sushi quality salmon (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\*\*
* 2 green onions
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds

*To Finish Bowls:*

* 1/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional
* \~1/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame, optional
* \~1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, optional
* \~1/4 cup daikon sprouts, optional
* other veggies such as carrots, cucumber, nori, bean sprouts, etc optional

\*\*I purchase fish marked for sushi/sashimi from a Japanese grocery store, but this isn't the only option available.

**To Prepare Sushi Rice:**

1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.
2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's ""prewashed""). Drain as much water as possible.
3. Add 1 3/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.
4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.
6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.
7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.

**To Prepare Veggies:**

1. Boil the edamame per package instructions (typically 3-4 minutes), then drain and season lightly with salt.
2. Peel the red onion and cut it in half, then slice as thin as possible until you have about 1/4 of a cup.
3. Clip daikon sprouts from their base and thoroughly rinse.
4. Prepare the avocado last, as it will brown if exposed to air for too long. Peel and thinly slice the 1/2 avocado as desired.

**To Prepare Sesame Salmon:**

1. Rinse the salmon thoroughly, then pat dry with paper towels. Using a very sharp chef's knife, slice the salmon into strips. Once in strips, slice again into cubes. You do not need a sushi knife, a sharp chef's knife will do. I make my cubes about 1/2 inch in size, but choose any size you prefer.
2. Remove the root tip of the green onions and discard, then slice as thinly as possible (green and white portions). After slicing, use your hands to separate the rings of the white portion as much as possible.
3. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the cubed salmon, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Mix until fully combined. *If not using immediately, cover and return to the fridge until ready to use.*

**To Finish Bowls:**

1. Divide the sushi rice evenly into the serving dishes, creating a wide, flat base.
2. Spoon the salmon into the serving bowls, discarding any sauce that remains in the mixing bowl. 
3. Top with veggies as desired, then serve immediately with a spoon and chopsticks.

I use Frank's, but you can use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce, or like my dad...you can make a little wing sauce concoction of all your favorite random hot sauces in your fridge.

**Ingredients:**

* 1¼  pounds chicken tenderloins
* ½ cup flour
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Frank’s RedHot Original Hot Sauce, or use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce
* 2 cups panko
* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced
* Neutral oil, for frying
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.

**Set up your dredging station:**

1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.

**Preheat the oil:**

1. Add about ¼ inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.

**Dredge the chicken:**

1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.

**Heat the sauce:**

1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.

**Fry the chicken tenders:**

1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350ºF.
2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165ºF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.

**Sauce the tenders:**

1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.
2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.

**To serve:**

1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions. Enjoy!"

It is essentially a baked bun stuffed with lamb and onions and seasoned with cumin. The skin should be thin and crispy while the meat filling should be juicy and highlights the original lamb fragrance.

&#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/pMCXCMQ1jXw)

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

\- 300g all-purpose flour

\- 2g salt

\- 2 tbsps (30ml or 15g) oil

\- 1 egg

\- 100ml water

Filling:

\- 300g boneless lamb leg

\- 1/2 red onion

\- 1.5 tsps salt

\- 1 tsp black pepper

\- 2 tsps cumin

&#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Mix the flour, salt, oil, egg, and water together to form a dough and roughly knead it for about 2 minutes. Cover it with a lid and let it rest for half an hour.
2. Dice the meat to the size of a corn kernel. The seasoning is very simple, just salt, black pepper, and cumin. This will highlight the original fragrance of lamb, and the cumin will add a touch of barbecue taste. Mix well and set it aside for later use.
3. Knead the dough until it is smooth. Divide the dough into 12 pieces evenly.
4. Roll out the dough to a round shape, ideally 7 to 8 inches in diameter. Place the filling in the center and fold the dough to a rectangular shape. Gently seal the seam.
5. Place all the samsas on a baking sheet, seam side down. Brush on a thin layer of the egg wash and decorate them with some sesame seeds.
6. Bake for 25 minutes at 400^(o)F. Enjoy!

&#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. One trick is to roll out the dough twice using a rolling pin. Roll out the dough to the size of your palm and thin out the edge during the first roll, you will feel some resistance because the dough is not fully relaxed yet. Set it aside and work on the next one. After you are done with the first six pieces, come back and roll the dough out for the second time. You’ll see that the dough is elastic and very easy to work with.

**Ingredients**

Donuts

* 1 cup milk lukewarm
* 1 tbsp active dry yeast
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 4 tbsp butter softened
* 4 1/4 cups flour all-purpose
* 1 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* vegetable oil for frying

Custard filling

* 4 egg yolks
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 3/4 cup maple syrup
* 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* 2 cups milk
* 1 tsp maple extract
* 2 tbsp butter unsalted, cold

Maple Glaze

* 2 cups icing sugar aka powdered sugar or confectioner's sugar
* 1 tbsp milk
* 1 1/2 tsp maple extract
* 6 slices bacon cooked and roughly chopped

**Instructions**

Dough

* Whisk the lukewarm milk, yeast, and 1 tsp of the sugar together. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes until the mixture becomes foamy. Whisk in the egg yolks and vanilla until well combined.
* Flour, butter, salt, remaining sugar, and prepared yeast mixture to the bowl of your stand mixer. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and start on low speed, working up to medium speed until the dough comes together. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is soft and elastic\*.
* Lightly grease a large mixing bowl. Shape the dough into a ball and place it into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free environment for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.

Custard

* Beat the egg yolks in a medium-sized mixing bowl just until smooth. Add the cornstarch, maple syrup, and salt to the bowl and continue to beat until combined and pale yellow, about 1 minute.
* Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it comes to a bare simmer. Remove the pan from the heat. Ladle the milk into the egg mixture, whisking until completely smooth between each ladle. Pour the mixture into the saucepan and return it to the stovetop over medium heat.
* Continuously whisk the mixture until it's bubbling and completely thickened. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the vanilla and butter and whisk until the custard is glossy and the butter has melted.
* Cover the custard with plastic wrap, carefully pressing the plastic directly against the surface of the custard. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until completely cooled.

Donuts

* Punch the risen dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out until about 1/2"" thick.
* Use a 3"" biscuit or cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough. You can knead the remaining dough back together to cut more rounds from it, but keep in mind the dough can become over-worked and result in donuts that aren't ideal.
* Place the rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving about 1"" of room between each one for room to rise. Lightly cover them with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow them to rise for 20-30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
* Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot with 3-4 inches of vegetable oil. Carefully add 2-3 risen dough rounds to the oil. Cook for about 1 minute, or until golden brown, then flip and cook for another minute or until golden. Remove the donuts with a slotted spoon and allow them to drain on a paper towel-lined plate while you fry the remainder.

Fill & Glaze

* Add the custard to a piping bag fitted with a piping tip. Insert a skewer or chopstick into each donut, moving it around to create a pocket inside for the custard. Insert the tip of your piping bag into the hole created by the skewer and fill with the donut with custard. Repeat with the remaining donuts and custard\*\*.
* Whisk the icing sugar, milk, and maple extract together until completely smooth. Taste the glaze and add more maple extract if needed. Dip the top of a donut into the glaze, then hold it on its side to let excess glaze drip off. Place the donut on a wire cookie rack and repeat with the remaining donuts.
* While the glaze is still wet, top each donut with the bacon pieces. Let the glaze set for 10-15 minutes before serving.

Notes

\*If the dough is **too sticky**, mix in 1 tbsp of flour at a time until smooth. If the dough is **too dry**, mix in 1 tbsp milk or water until smooth.

\*If you end up with extra custard, you can enjoy it like pudding! Top it with a drizzle of the glaze and some bacon pieces."

https://kitchenblackbox.com/moroccan-semolina-pancakes-beghrir-1000-hole-pancakes/

## Ingredients:

* 2 cups (350g) fine durum wheat semolina
* 1 cup (150g) all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon (10g) dry yeast
* 1 tablespoon (15g) baking powder
* 3 1/2 cups (800ml) lukewarm water
* A pinch of salt
* 1 teaspoon (5g) caster sugar (optional)

## Directions:

## Making the Batter:

1. Dissolve yeast in a little slightly warm water.
2. In a mixing bowl, place the dry ingredients; flour, semolina, salt, sugar, baking powder, add diluted yeast, add lukewarm water and mix. You can transfer the batter to a blender or use a hand blender to smooth the preparation. The consistency of the batter should not be too thick nor too liquid.
3. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes. After the rest, your batter should be slightly frothy.

## Cooking and Serving the Beghrir Pancakes:

1. Over medium heat, heat a non-stick crepe pan, pour a small ladle of batter into the center of the hot pan, spread it delicately, and cook on one side for about 3 minutes or until the surface is dry (never flip the beghrir crepes). Your beghrir is perfectly cooking when you notice dozens of small holes formed on the top. When cooked, it should be soft and spongy but not sticky. Also, if you notice some residue on your pan, you can clean it using an oiled paper towel to prevent the next crepe from sticking.
2. Once cooked, place the crepes separately on a clean cloth. Avoid immediately putting one on top of the other because they will stick together.
3. Serve these Moroccan crepes warm with your favorite toppings on the side or dip them in honey-butter syrup. Beghrir is typically accompanied by Moroccan mint tea."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jgu2ka,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jgu2ka,reddit,"I've never made anything with dough before, here is my version of the recipe I found:

**Recipe: Cinnamon Rolls**

**Ingredients**

**Dough**

* 1 cup whole milk warmed (105-140°)
* 2 packages (or 5 teaspoons) active dry yeast
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 5 cups all-purpose flour separated (plus extra for rolling out the dough)
* 3 large eggs room temperature
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature, cut into chunks
* 2 teaspoons fine sea salt

**Filling and Glaze(Egg wash)**

* 1 egg, room temperature, slightly beaten for sealing edge and egg wash on top
* 3/4 cup firmly-packed light brown sugar
* 2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/3 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, separated

**Icing**

* 1 block Cream Cheese
* 1 cup Powdered Sugar
* 1 tbs unsalted butter
* 1/8 tsp vanilla

**Directions**

* Grow the yeast: Add the warmed milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or just in a bowl. The milk should feel very warm to the touch, but not scalding hot. Use a thermometer to gauge exact temperature if desired. Sprinkle over the yeast, and stir to moisten. Allow to stand until foamy, about 5-7 minutes.
* Make the dough: Add sugar, 4 1/2 cups of flour, eggs, butter and salt to the yeast. Place remaining 1/2 cup of flour in a small bowl. Mix on low just until the contents of the stand mixer come together. Do not over mix. Double check to makes sure you have added all of the aforementioned ingredients before moving on to the kneading stage.
* Knead the Dough: I kneaded by hand for 10 minutes, adding in bits of the last of the flour as necessary. Here is from the recipe: Remove the paddle attachment and attach the dough hook. Knead the dough on low speed (e.g. speed 2 if using a KitchenAid® stand mixer), and continue to so for 5-7 minutes, adding in the reserved flour 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the sides of the bowl. Alternatively, knead the dough by hand.
* Dough Rise: Have ready a large oiled bowl. Once the dough is properly kneaded, appearing smooth and elastic in texture, transfer to the oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to proof in a warm, draft-free spot until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 - 2 hours.
* Filling:  Have ready a greased 9x13” baking dish, and prepare the egg wash by beating together the egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Set aside until ready to use. To make the filling, in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Set aside until ready to use.
* Roll 'em out: Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut in half with a sharp knife. Set one half aside, and begin working with the other. Lightly dust the dough with flour. Pat out the dough into the shape of a rectangle. Using a rolling pin dusted with flour, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring close to 12 x 14”. Rotate the dough (if necessary) so that one of the short sides is in front of you.
* Fill 'em: Spread half of the butter across the surface of the dough, stopping about 1” from the short side opposite of you. Sprinkle with half of the cinnamon sugar mixture, and rub across with the butter, patting to adhere and taking care to leave cleared space at end for egg wash. Brush the clear area lightly with the egg wash. Set aside egg wash and reserve.
* Roll 'em up: Starting on the short side closest to you, begin rolling into a log. Once rolled, pinch together the seam and place seam-side down on your work surface. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut off the tapered ends and discard.
* Cut Rolls: Cut the log into 6 equal pieces. Stagger the rolls evenly across half of the greased baking dish. Repeat with the remaining log, and proceed to fill the dish. You should have 12 cinnamon rolls total. I wasn't careful enough with forming, rolling out, or cutting, so I got 16 and cooked the ends also. Unflavored dental floss is best for cutting them, slide a piece underneath and wrap it around up to the top and cross the strings and pull.
* Second Rise: Cover the rolls loosely with a kitchen towel, and allow them to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until they have doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
* Bake: Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350°. Brush the reserved egg mixture across the top of the cinnamon rolls. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Set aside and allow to cool slightly.
* Icing: Whisk room temp icing ingredients until smooth. Pour across rolls and spread.
* Inhale"

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 8 scallions, divided
* 1 large potato, peeled and diced
* 3 cups water
* 5 ounces spinach
* 15-ounce can full-fat coconut milk
* 16 ounces fresh or frozen udon
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving, optional:**

* Sesame oil
* Black sesame seeds

**Prepare the scallions:**

1. Clean and trim the scallions. Cut off the green parts from 4 of the scallions and reserve for garnish. Cut all of the remaining scallions into thirds.

**Prepare the scallion garnish:**

1. Cut the 4 scallion greens in half cross-wise. Using a sharp knife, cut the halved pieces in half again lengthwise to create a flat side. Very thinly slice each of these flat pieces of scallion greens into thin matchsticks, about 1/8-inch or 1/16-inch wide. The scallion slices will curl naturally. Set them aside in a bowl and reserve for garnish.

**Prepare the broth:**

1. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add cut scallions to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until bright green about 5–7 minutes. The scallions shouldn’t brown, so adjust the heat as necessary to prevent browning.
2. Add the diced potato and pour in the water. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes or until the potato is fork tender.

**Cook the noodles:**

1. As the broth simmers, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the udon according to package instructions and then drain and rinse. Set aside.

**Cook the spinach:**

1. After the broth has simmered, add the spinach to the pot and cook for 5 minutes until bright green. Do not overcook the spinach! Turn off the heat and allow the broth to cool for 5 minutes.

**Blend the broth:**

1. Transfer the broth to a food processor or blender. Pulse until smooth. Add the coconut milk and blend once more until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**To Serve:**

1. Ladle the broth into shallow bowls. Place a portion of the udon on top and arrange the scallion slices on top. Garnish with a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkle of black sesame seeds. Enjoy!"

I'm participating in Veganuary this year, and this will be one of the dishes I have on repeat! It's so good and so easy to make.

If you're not vegan, feel free to use dairy butter! I served this with fettuccine, and it was amazing. You could also serve these chickpeas over roasted veggies like cauliflower or eggplant, cooked rice, or even a simple risotto.

Servings: 4 

Calories: 640kcal per serving

**Ingredients**

* 12 ounces fettuccine
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
* 2 15- ounce cans chickpeas, drained
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and finely minced
* 2 tablespoons capers, drained
* Pinch of crushed red pepper, optional
* 4 tablespoons plant-based butter
* ¾ cup water or vegetable stock
* ¼ cup lemon juice
* ¼ cup loosely packed parsley, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Roast the chickpeas:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF. Arrange the chickpeas on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Transfer to the oven for 20–30 minutes, flipping the chickpeas once midway through cooking.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and the fettuccine. Cook according to package instructions. Scoop out ½ cup pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the capers to the onion and cook for 1–2 minutes until they just begin to crisp and turn golden brown. Season with crushed red pepper if you like.
2. Melt the butter into the onions and capers. Once melted and frothy add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until reduced by half. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Stir the lemon juice into the sauce and add the roasted chickpeas. Toss to coat and cook for 3–4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings to your preferences.
2. Add half the pasta cooking water and minced parsley and bring to a boil. Add the cooked fettuccine and toss to coat for 1–2 minutes. Add the remaining pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the cooked pasta between shallow bowls. Enjoy!

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jqwj16,https://i.redd.it/cs8slkcgh7y51.jpg,reddit,"**Ingredients**

***For the crust:***

* 150 g flour
* 65 g sugar
* 65 g butter
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon baking powder

***For the filling:***

* 750 g quark (Got a lot of questions for subsitutes, check out my ETA below)
* 100 g white sugar
* 1 ½ - 2 Pck. (bake-proof) vanilla pudding powder mix (depends on the instruction for 500 ml milk)
* 500 ml milk
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 pck. vanilla sugar (or one vanilla bean)
* ½ Lemon(s), juice thereof
* Mix of 50 ml oil and 100 g melted unsalted butter (sunflower oil or rapeseed oil, definitly not olive oil, it has to be on that is neutral in taste. If you don't have one, skip the oil use 150 g of melted butter instead).

***For the meringue topping:***

* 3 egg whites
* 100 g white sugar

&#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. Make a dough using the ingredients for the crust. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
2. Mix the vanilla pudding powder with the sugar and add milk to make the pudding (alternatively you can probably make regular pudding, in that case let it cool to room temperature before using). If you have a mix that requires hot milk, let it cool before proceeding.
3. In a large bowl add quark to the pudding and mix well. Then add the melted butter and oil, mix. You should notice that this help smoothing out the texture of the mixture. Finally, add the eggyolks and lemon juice and mix until everything is fully incorporated. (Note: it is a quite liqidy mixture)
4. Pre-heat oven to 200° C. Roll out your dough, spread out in your sheeted 26-28 cm spring form. Press the dough against the wall of the form to build a crust of about 3 cm.
5. Pour your filling in and bake on middle rack for 45 minutes.
6. In the meanwhile, beat the egg whites while adding the sugar slowly until the foamy mixture doubles in volume. DO NOT skimp on the sugar here, otherwise the droplets cannot form.
7. Get the cake out of the oven and turn the heat down to 150°C. Gently splash the eggwhite spoon by spoon on the cake. Bake for another 20-22 minutes.
8. Take the cake out and let cool to room temperature. DO NOT remove the baking form or cover up before completly cool. While cooling, little golden droplets develop on the surface because the sugar in the eggwhite caramelize when exposed to the air. Due to this effect, the cake is called „Golden droplet cake“ or „Teardrop cake“ in German.

ETA: Since a lot of people have said that quark might not be easily found in their area, here are my suggestions for substitution:

* Here is a very easy recipe for making quark at home: [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240584/quark-homemade-cheese/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240584/quark-homemade-cheese/). I have not tried it myself but it sounds good to meand the consistency in the photo seems right
* Greek yoghurt (If it's very liquidy, drain it though a cheese cloth before use)
* Sour cream (same, drain if necessary)
* I would actually try half greek yoghurt and half sour cream. From my experience with the products you can get in Germany, I  think that would get the closest to the consistency and taste you are looking for.
* Cottage cheese should work well as suggested by u/wouser86
* If you are gonna use cream cheese, then try to find a light one.
* If you are using any of the substitutes, taste the mixture along the way and add lemon juice or sugar if necessary. There is no right or wrong to how sweet or sour it has to be, whatever you think is good should work."

Ingredients:

7 lb Beef Chuck Short Rib (Dino Ribs)
ChupacabraRub Season-All and Brisket Magic

Spritz: water and apple cider vinegar 1:1 ratio

1 chimney of oak lump charcoal
5 post oak smoking logs

Preparation:

Trim the excess fat from the top of the Dino ribs.
Let come to room temperature and season the top and sides of the ribs. (We used ChupacabraRub, but you can substitute with your favorite bbq rubs or just salt and pepper 1:1 ratio)
Bring the smoker to a constant temperature of 275°F.

Place the ribs in the middle of the smoker.
After 1 hour spritz the ribs every 30 minutes.

The next part comes to personal preference:
1) wrap the ribs in butcher paper at an internal temperature of around 145-150°F for more juicier ribs
2) wrap the ribs in butcher paper at an internal temperature of around 160-165°F for that nice dark bark

We went with option #1 and wrapped at around 150°F.

Pull from the smoker when the ribs have reached an internal temperature of 205°F.
The total cook time will vary depending on size of the smoker and weather conditions.
For two racks of Dino ribs weighing in at 7 pounds total took 6 1/2 hours at a smoking temperature of 275°F.
Once pulled from the smoker let rest for at least 30 minutes.

Ingredients 

Pastry

2.5 cups white all purpose flour

Pinch of salt 

200g chilled salted butter 

8 - 10 tablespoons icy cold water 

30g pecorino or parmesan cheese shaved or grated 

1 egg yolk for brushing the pastry

Mushroom Filling

375g white cup mushrooms thinly sliced 

1 white onion diced

3 large garlic cloves crushed 

Fresh thyme 

2 tablespoons butter

Olive oil 

2 tablespoons smooth ricotta 

100g bocconcini cheese sliced 

50g pecorino or parmesan cheese shaved or grated 

Salt and pepper

Handful of rocket (optional)

Lemon (optional)

Method

Pastry

Chill a large bowl, grater and stick of butter in the freezer for 20 minutes. 

Combine your flour and salt in the chilled bowl and whisk together. Grate your butter and add to the flour with your pecorino breaking the butter down with your fingertips until you have a pebble like crumbly texture. 

Create a well in the centre of your flour and pour in your icy cold water. Use a fork to bring your dough together. Do your best to moisten most of your dough so it is moist and shaggy. 

Lightly dust your kitchen bench with flour and knead your dough into a disc shape. Cut your dough in half, wrap each piece in glad wrap and leave to sit overnight or for a minimum of one hour in the fridge. You will only need half of this dough mixture to make the galette so keep the other half in the freezer for the next time you want to make this! 

Filling

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius.

On a low heat in a large frying pan, fry your onion with a generous amount of olive oil for five minutes or until translucent and fragrant. Add in your garlic and fry for an additional minute or two. 

 Combine half of your mushrooms to the pan with the onion and garlic, a sprinkling of fresh thyme and salt and pepper and one tablespoon of butter. Sauté for five minutes and then set to the side in a separate bowl. Repeat this step with the second half of the mushrooms. Have a little taste of your mushrooms and check all seasoning is to your liking. You may want to add more salt, pepper or thyme. 

Take one disc of dough out of the fridge and sprinkle your kitchen bench with flour. With a rolling pin, roll your dough out to a large rectangular shape about 4mm thick. Place your dough onto a flat baking tray with baking paper. 

Leaving a 4cm boarder around the edge of the dough, smear your ricotta on the bottom of the dough, sprinkle a handful of pecorino over the ricotta and then assemble the sliced bocconcini on top of the pecorino. Layer on your mushrooms over the cheese. 

Fold in the overhanging pastry pinching some of the dough together to create a rustic rectangular shape. 

Whisk your egg yolk, add in a splash of water and brush your dough with it. This will help create a lovely golden colour when cooking.

Place your galette into the oven for 30 minutes. Leave to rest for 15 minutes until serving so the cheese can slightly set. 

Sprinkle some fresh rocket over the galette and squeeze some lemon juice all over."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8jwed8,https://i.redd.it/pide5jxpx8y01.jpg,reddit,"Cookies
2¾ cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1¼ cups granulated sugar
¼ cup dark brown sugar (light brown sugar will work, too)
2 large eggs, room temperature
½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Cinnamon Sugar
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
2½ teaspoons cinnamon



Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a baking pan with parchment paper or a non-stick baking mat.

In a bowl, mix together dry ingredients - flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon; set aside.
In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (hand-held mixers work too), cream together butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar. Next add vanilla extract and eggs one at a time, mixing after each. Scrape down sides of the bowl as necessary.

With mixer on low-speed, gradually add the bowl of dry ingredients and mix until incorporated, do not over-mix though.

Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Can also place in the refrigerator if you plan on making the cookies later. You do not have to chill the dough, but it is much easier to roll into a ball if it is chilled a little.


To make the cinnamon sugar, mix sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.

Measure about 1½ tablespoons of dough, roll into a ball and then roll in cinnamon sugar and place on prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes (mine baked for 9). I've had a few comments about them not being fully baked at 10 minutes. Every oven is different so it may take up to 20 minutes for your cookies to fully bake through. I suggest starting at 10 minutes and then watch them from there. However, you do not want to over bake as snickerdoodle cookies are known for their soft and chewy texture. Cookies will look puffy when they are done, remove from oven and let cool slightly on baking sheet then move to cookie sheet to cool completely. Cookies will flatten a little as they cool."

**Ingredients:**

* 4 scallops (as fresh as you can get)
* 100 grams of ""zeeuws spek"" (spiced and smoked pork belly)
* Green asparagus tips
* 200 ml of white wine
* 1 shallot
* 100 grams of cold butter
* A splash of cream (around 1 tbsp)
* Finely chopped chives for garnish
* Edible flowers for garnish
* Bones, head, and skin of one smoked mackerel or eel
* Two sticks of celery
* 1 carrot
* Half a leek
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 onion
* 2 bay leaves

**Directions:**

1. If you are making your stock from scratch, this is where we should start. First clean and rough-chop your vegetables. Add the fishbones and all the vegetables to a large pot and cover with about two liters of water, bring to a simmer and let this simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes. In the meantime skim any foam off the pan to create a nice and clear broth. After this 30 minutes simmer, we are going to strain the stock in another pot and put it back on medium-high heat, and continue till the stock is reduced to ⅓ of what you started with.
2. Now it is time to prepare the sauce. finely chop the shallot and sautee for 2 minutes on medium heat. add 200 ml of white wine and 200 ml of your already reduced stock. let this simmer until reduced by half and then strain out the onions and add your reduction back to the pan. Set this aside for now.
3. Fill a small pan with water and bring to a boil. Then blanch your asparagus for about two minutes. Drain them and cool them down with cold water. Slice your bacon/zeeuws spek in thick slices and trim them until they almost have the size of a scallop.
4. Now it’s time to finish the dish. Put your saucepan on low heat with your reduction. Start with frying your bacon in a dry pan on medium heat until crispy golden brown. let them drain on a piece of kitchen paper and then sear your scallops for two minutes on the first side, so they turn nicely golden brown. On the other side I usually sear a little bit shorter because you don’t want to overcook them; about 60-90 seconds.
5. Finish the sauce by adding the cream to your warm reduction and simmer for 30 seconds. then turn off the heat and add your cubed cold butter in small batches while whisking and incorporating the butter in the sauce. serve the scallops and bacon on the asparagus. Add the beurre blanc sauce and the chives and flowers as garnish. Enjoy!"

St. Joseph pastries, also known as Zeppole di San Giuseppe, are enjoyed every year on March 19th to celebrate the Feast of San Giuseppe (Saint Joseph). They are a deliciously light Italian cream filled pastry. This recipe is for zeppole al forno, or baked zeppole.

Prep time: 15 minutes  / Cook time: 30 minutes / Makes: 12

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Choux Pastry

* 1/2 c butter
* 1/2 c granulated sugar
* 1 c water
* 1 c all-purpose flour
* 4 extra-large eggs

#### Crema Pasticcera

* 4 egg yolks
* 2 c whole milk
* 1/2 c granulated sugar
* 3 Tbsp cornstarch
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Lemon zest from 1 lemon

#### Additional Toppings

* Confectioners sugar
* Pitted cherries (either sour or maraschino)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Crema Pasticcera (Pastry Cream)

* In a pot over low heat, warm up the milk and vanilla until it starts to steam.
* In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar, then add the cornstarch and whisk again until smooth.
* Once the milk has warmed up, add about 1/2 c of the milk to the egg mixture while constantly whisking. This will temper the eggs, so you don’t wind up with scrambled eggs.
* Increase the heat on the stove to low-medium and add the egg mixture and lemon zest to the milk, whisking continuously. After a few minutes, the crema pasticcera will thicken up to a thick custard-like consistency.
* Remove from heat, place in a bowl, and let cool on the counter for a few minutes.
* Once the bowl is cool enough to handle, cover it with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic touches the cream. This will prevent it from forming a crust. Place in the refrigerator to cool further.

#### Choux Pastry Dough

* Preheat oven to 400°F.
* In a pot over medium heat, bring butter, sugar, and water to a rolling boil.
* Next, add all of the flour at once and vigorously stir until it forms a ball.
* Remove pot from the heat and add eggs one at a time then stirring until each egg is thoroughly incorporated. By the third or fourth egg, you may want to switch to a whisk. Whisk until it reaches a consistency like a thick icing (not like a bread dough at all!).
* Let cool a few minutes.
* Prepare a baking sheet lined with either a silicone mat or parchment paper.
* Place pastry dough in a piping bag with a star tip (or a Ziplok bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
* Pipe dough into circles measuring about 4 inches in diameter, working from the inside out, then make a second layer on top of the first, but leave a hole in the center of the second layer (this is where the pastry cream will be added later). Make sure to leave a few inches between each one, as they will puff up a bit while baking.
* Bake for 30 minutes or until the dough turns a light golden brown. When lightly pressed with a finger, the zeppole will have slightly spongy feel, like a doughnut.
* Let cool on the counter.

#### Putting It All Together

* Once the zeppole have cooled, remove the crema pasticcera from the fridge and place in a piping bag with a star tip (or a Ziplok bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
* Pipe the cream into the center of each zeppole and continue around, making a circle of cream, then back to the middle for a tall center.
* Lightly dust with powdered sugar and top with a cherry."

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/carne-asada-quesadillas/](https://maplewoodroad.com/carne-asada-quesadillas/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 lb skirt steak
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed and roughly chopped
* 2 teaspoon cumin
* 2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 2 teaspoon chili powder
* 1-½ tablespoon fresh lime juice
* 1-½ tablespoon olive oil
* Half a bunch of cilantro, chopped
* 1-½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
1-½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon chopped jalapeños (optional)
* 4 oz grated sharp cheddar cheese
* 4 oz grated pepper jack cheese
* 4 (8-inch) flour tortillas  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. First, we create the marinade. In a bowl, mix some crushed and roughly chopped garlic cloves (no need to mince), freshly squeezed lemon juice, olive oil, cilantro, and some chopped jalapeños (if used). 
2. Trim the meat if necessary and pat it dry with a paper towel.
3. Season with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, cumin, smoked paprika, and chili powder. 
4. Use your hand to press these dry ingredients onto the meat. 
5. Place the meat in a Ziploc bag and add the marinade.
6. Gently massage the bag to make sure the marinade evenly coats all of the meat.
7. Try to press out as much air as possible before closing the bag. 
8. Put the bag on a plate and place it in the fridge for at least an hour (but not more than 10 hours). 
9. Massage and turn occasionally to get the marinate working, especially if you plan to marinate for only an hour or so.
10. Once you’re ready to cook the meat, add just a little bit of a neutral oil, like canola, to a cast iron pan and bring it to medium-high heat. That means to a heat where the oil is really hot but is not smoking yet.
11. Grab the meat with tongs from the Ziploc bag and shake off some of the excessive marinade and the larger garlic chunks.
12. Add the meat to the pan. It should instantly sizzle and smoke a little when touching the hot oil.
13. Cook for about 3 minutes per side (depending on the thickness of the cut).
14. Check with an instant meat thermometer. It should read 130-140℉ in the thickest part.
15. Remove from the pan, place on a cutting board, and lightly cover with foil.
16. While resting the steak for a couple of minutes, grate the cheeses. 
17. Next, slice the beef - against the grain - in small, bite-sized strips.
18. Carefully wipe out the cast iron pan with a paper towel without burning yourself. It’s okay if the pan is not completely clean. Any little scraps will only add flavor to the tortilla. 
19. Put the pan back on the stove and turn it up to medium heat.
20. Add a soft taco/tortilla to the dry pan (one that fits the diameter of the pan).
21. Sprinkle the whole width of the tortilla with a quarter of the cheese, then add a layer of beef strips to half of the tortilla.
22. When the cheese starts to melt (which takes maybe 1 or 2 minutes), gently - with a spatula - fold the taco/tortilla in half and also gently press it flat so that it looks like a quesadilla should look. 
23. Flip the whole enchilada 😂 and cook on the other side for another 2 minutes or until the cheese is completely melted. 
24. Slide onto a cutting board and cut in half. A pizza cutter works like a charm. A knife works perfectly fine as well.
25. Place on a plate or cutting board and sprinkle some chopped cilantro over the top. That’s just for good looks.
26. Serve with your favorite accompaniments, such as guacamole, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, black beans, rice, etc. Enjoy!"

Insight:

* Meat surface browning intensifies the flavour thanks to Millard reactions. In the process, carbohydrates react with amino acids creating hundreds of delicious compounds.
* At a temperature of 70C (158F) connective tissue collagen begins to dissolve into gelatin making meat significantly more tender.

I love quick ramen and there is nothing more satisfying than a spicy, tahini broth. This spicy, fast vegetarian ramen recipe is the best way to cure your craving.

Prep Time: 5 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Total Time: 35 minutes

Servings: 4 

Calories: 506kcal

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Medium pot
* Small sieve
* Colander

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into half-moons
* 4 ounces baby shiitake mushrooms
* 6 cups vegetable stock
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons vegetarian dashi granules
* 2 tablespoons mirin
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 4 5- ounce frozen noodle packs if using Sun Noodle variety
* 4 eggs
* 1/3 cup tahini paste
* 1 heaping tablespoon white miso
* 2 –3 tablespoons chili oil more or less depending on preference
* Salt to taste

#### For serving:

* Microgreens or sliced scallions
* Shichimi-togarashi
* Chili oil optional

### Instructions

#### Start the noodles:

* Fill a medium pot with water and bring to a boil.

#### Cook the broth:

* Heat the avocado oil in a large pot over medium-high heat as you wait for the water to boil. Add the onion and mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes until they begin to soften.

#### Simmer the broth:

* Pour in the vegetable stock. Add the soy sauce, dashi granules, mirin, and sesame oil to the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and allow it to simmer vigorously for about 15–20 minutes or until the onions are soft. Taste and season to your preferences.

#### Cook the noodles:

* As you wait for the broth to finish simmering, cook the noodles according to package instructions. Frozen ramen will only need to cook for two or so minutes. Then, drain the noodles into a strainer and divide them between bowls.
* Fill the pot back up halfway with water and return to the stove over medium heat. Add the distilled white vinegar. Bring the water back to a vigorous simmer.

#### Poach the eggs:

* Place a small sieve over a bowl. Crack the first egg into the sieve and drop it carefully from the sieve into the simmering water. Use a wooden spoon to gently collect any wispy whites toward the egg.
* Continue on with the remaining eggs, dropping each one into the sieve and then into the water. Allow the eggs to poach until the whites have set, about 4–5 minutes. Remove the eggs in the order you dropped them into the water as the first egg you dropped in will be poached sooner than the egg you dropped in last.
* Transfer each egg to a bowl of noodles.

#### Finish the broth:

* Take the broth off the heat. Temper the tahini by scooping out one cup of the hot broth and whisking the tahini, miso, and chili oil into the warm liquid until smooth. Pour the mixture back into the pot and stir until smooth. Taste and season to your preferences.

#### To serve:

Good luck!

# Ingredients

*Makes \~4 servings*

* Pasta
* 2 tablespoons of neutral oil
* 8 oz brick of extra sharp cheddar cheese
* 12 oz can of evaporated milk
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* pinch of cayenne pepper
* pinch of white pepper
* 2 pinches of dried mustard powder
* 1/2 tablespoon of butter
* Optional: 1/2 teaspoon of unassuming vinegar (white or unseasoned rice vinegar are two options).

# Method

1. Begin heating a pot of salted water over high heat
2. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a separate medium sauce pot and set to low heat. Optional: add 1 tsp of annatto seeds and heat until the oil is colored crimson. Removes seeds after a few seconds.
3. Grate an 8 oz brick of extra-sharp cheddar cheese and add to pot.
4. Pour a 12 oz can of evaporated milk into the pot.
5. Add salt and all your spices.
6. Once the mixture is hot and all the cheese is dissolving, use a hand blender to emulsify it all into a creamy sauce. If you don’t have a hand blender, you can poor it into a counter-top blender or perhaps use a whisk. Optional: if you find that the sauce is missing some “zing”, add a 1/2 tsp of vinegar. 
7. Once the pasta is cooked through, strain with a colander and set under the faucet of your sink. Wash away the excess starch with hot water.
8. Add a portion of your cooked pasta into the cheese sauce. Mix and add more pasta if needed. Mix in a tab of butter to smooth out the flavors. Season to taste.
9. For optional breadcrumb topping: 1) melt butter in pan on medium-low heat, 2) add panko and salt, 3) toast until golden brown.
10. Pour the ooey-gooey goodness into a heated bowl. Dust with breadcrumbs if using. Bask in its glory. Eat with fork or spoon - whatever floats your boat. Enjoy."
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ia5nju,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ia5nju,reddit," There is nothing better than crunchy pastry filled with sweet seafood and vegetables, dipped in a sauce that explodes with flavours on your tongue. Easy to prepare can also be baked as a healthier option for anybody who watches calories after a lockdown. Delicious lunch, snack or party food, this are made to the proper size that fits in hand.

On this occasion for the first batch, I used Crab meat from Devon and a few Scollops that I purchased on the seaside market. for the second batch, I used Surimi from my local supermarket. Both variations were super tasty!

**Ingredients for 16 spring rolls** (5 inches long) **:**

* 16 sheets of 10-inch (25cm) spring roll pastry (you can use a smaller size if you prefer)
* 400g (14oz) of Seafood (Surimi, chopped prawns, picked crab meat, crayfish tails, chopped seared scallops)
* 120g (4.2oz) of bamboo shoots cut julienne
* 100g (3.5oz) of Nappa cabbage, shredded 
* 100g (3.5oz) of bean shoots 
* 100g (3.5oz) of onions, sliced
* 50g (1.8oz) of carrot cut julienne
* 50g (1.8oz)of celery thinly sliced
* 10g (half a bunch) of coriander chopped
* 2tbsp of sesame oil
* Oil for deep frying

**Ingredients for the sauce:**

* 50g (1.8oz) of sweet soy sauce (or 25g if using dark soy sauce)
* 25g (0.9oz) of sweet chilli sauce
* 1tsp of lime juice
* 5g (1tsp) of grated ginger
* 1tsp of sesame oil
* 1tsp of mirin

**Method:**

**1.** In a small pan, heat 2tbsp of sesame oil and sweat the onions on medium heat until soft then transfer to a bowl and mix with chopped bamboo shoots, cabbage, bean shoots, carrots, celery, coriander and seafood.

**2.** Wrap in the pastry as shown on the photos, use water with a little bit of flour to seal and place on a tray ready for later (make sure you pack the filling tightly without air pockets). If possible you can chill spring rolls before deep frying for the extra crispy result.

**3.** Next, heat the oil for deep frying to 180C (356F) and fry until golden brown, alternatively brush with a little oil and bake in the 200C (392F) oven for around 20-30 minutes.

**4.** For the dressing mix all the ingredients together and serve & enjoy!

**Insight:**

* Most of the ocean creatures balance the saltiness of seawater by filling their cells with amino acids, one of them, glycine is sweet the other one glutamic acid is savoury and mouth-filling. Shellfish are especially rich in these and other tasty amino acids!

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 50 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 5 minutes 

Servings: 5

Calories: 592kcal 

### Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot
* Colander
* Baking dish (You can also bake in the wide pot if it is oven-safe)

### Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 12 ounces baby bella mushrooms trimmed, scrubbed, and minced
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1/4 cup white wine or vermouth
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 3-4 tablespoons flour
* 1 cup vegetable stock plus more, if needed
* 3 cups whole milk gently warmed on stove or in microwave
* 16 ounces dry rigatoni
* Scant amount of nutmeg optional
* 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Dry or fresh parsley for garnish

### Instructions

#### Before Starting:

* Preheat oven to 400ºF.

#### Brown the Onion:

* In a wide pot, heat the 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat until very hot. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, until well-browned and beginning to caramelize, about 15-20 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

#### Cook the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the rigatoni about 3-4 minutes under al dente. Drain and set aside.

#### Cook the Mushrooms:

* Add the minced mushrooms and cook an additional 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.
* Add the wine or vermouth and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Allow the liquid to cook off for 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

#### Cook the Sliced Mushrooms:

* Heat the butter in the pot and add the sliced mushrooms. Cook until very golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and dry thyme.
* Return the minced mushrooms and onion to the pot and stir to combine.

#### Prepare the Roux:

* Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir to combine. Cook until aromatic, about 2-3 minutes being careful not to burn the flour.
* Pour in the stock, whisking as you incorporate. Continue whisking until thick. Add the warm milk, one ladle at a time, whisking after each incorporation until all the milk has been added. Bring to a very low, bubbly boil and then reduce heat and simmer. Stir regularly. The sauce should be velvety and a little thick. It will thicken up more as it bakes. Taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

#### Prepare the Casserole:

* Spoon a few ladles of the sauce on the bottom of the casserole and add 1/3 of the pasta. Pour a few more ladles of sauce on top of the pasta. If desired, add a scant amount of ground nutmeg on top (no more than 1/8 teaspoon). Continue on with pasta, sauce, scant nutmeg (optional) two more times until all the pasta and sauce have been used.
* Sprinkle the casserole with the parmesan cheese and transfer to the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until bubbly and the cheese has melted and is turning golden brown in places. Remove from the oven and garnish with fresh or dry minced parsley.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and garnish with more parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

Don't wait and surprise your partner with this cloudy sweetness! Or don't tell the other half and eat just by yourself :)

This recipe makes one portion to share.

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\- 3 organic egg yolks

\- 2tbsp of caster sugar

\- 2tbsp of whisky (you can also use Marsala or Cognac)

\- 75ml of double or whipping cream

\- few strawberries

\- few blueberries

\- chocolate wafer (optional)

&#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1.In the metal bowl, mix 3 egg yolks with 2tbsp caster sugar until sugar dissolves.

2.Add 2tbsp of whisky and combine (You can also use Marsala or Cognac)

3.Whisk Zabaione over the Bain-marie for around 2 minutes, you can control the temperature by lifting the bowl (Be careful not to burn yourself, if the water is boiling to rapidly lower the stove temperature)

4.Once Zabaione turns pale yellow and consistency seems thick but still runny remove from the heat.

5.In the separate bowl whisk 75ml of double or whipping cream.

6.Gently fold in the whipped cream into the Zabaione (Do not mix or whisk)

7.Transfer to the champagne glass, add summer fruits and enjoy this beautiful dessert!

&#x200B;

**Insight:**

\- Egg yolk thickens at the temperature of 65C (149F) and sets at 70C (158F) while egg whites need 80C (176F) to coagulate.

\- By gently folding cream you preserve the air bubbles that were created during the whipping. Mixing, whisking and overfolding destroy this fragile structure.

\- Double and whipping cream foams thanks to the high amount of fat (30%-48%)

&#x200B;

Dough:

	▪ 1 cup milk

	▪ 2 7 g packages of active dry yeast

	▪ 4 1/2 cups flour

	▪ 1/2 cup granulated white sugar

	▪ 1/2 tsp salt

	▪ 2 eggs, room temperature

	▪ 1/3 cup butter, melted

&#x200B;

Filling:

	▪ 1/2 cup hazelnuts

	▪ 2/3 cup dark chocolate chips or chunks

	▪ 1/4 cup granulated white sugar

	▪ 1/3 cup butter, room temperature

&#x200B;

Glaze:

	▪ 2 tbsp milk

	▪ 1 cup powder sugar

	▪ 1 tsp vanilla bean paste or seeds from 1 vanilla bean

	▪ 1 tsp vanilla extract

&#x200B;

Dough recipe:

	▪ In a large bowl, mix together flour and salt.

	▪ In the microwave, heat milk until it is warm, but not hot, to the touch (about 110-115° F). Add yeast to the warm milk and let sit until bubbly and frothy, about 10 minutes.

	▪ In a mixer with the dough hook attached, combine sugar, salt, eggs, and melted butter, and whisk slightly to combine. Add milk and yeast mixture and about 1 cup flour.

	▪ Mix on low, adding flour, about one cup at a time, until dough comes together and is no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl.

	▪ Knead on medium speed for 5 minutes, or until dough is smooth.

	▪ Lightly grease a large bowl with baking spray, butter, or vegetable oil. Place dough in the bowl, flipping to cover it with the oil. Place plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel over the bowl.  Let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until dough has doubled in size. Meanwhile, make the filling. Prepare a 9""x13"" baking pan by spraying with nonstick baking spray or lining with parchment paper.

	▪ Punch down the risen dough, and roll it out into a 10""x18"" rectangle on a clean surface.

	▪ Spread the filling evenly over the dough. 

	▪ Roll the dough up lengthwise. Trim the ends, then cut the dough into 12 even rolls.

	▪ Place the rolls in the prepared baking dish, cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 350F about 20-30 minutes before rolls are ready to bake. Meanwhile, make the icing.

	▪ Bake rolls for 25-30 minutes, or until the tops are lightly golden brown.

	▪ Top rolls with icing while they're still warm. Enjoy!

	

Filling:

	▪ Use a food processor to combine hazelnuts, chocolate, and sugar until chocolate and nuts are chopped into small pieces.

	▪ Add butter and pulse until butter is just incorporated. If you have a hard time getting the butter smooth in the food processor, use a spatula to finish combining.

Icing:

In a bowl combine, sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and vanilla bean paste or seeds scraped from 1 vanilla bean. Stir until it forms a thick, smooth icing."

4 small whole sea bass (each about 600g), gutted and cleaned

1 head of garlic, peeled and cut into quarters

8 large sprigs of rosemary

Olive oil, for drizzling

Sea salt

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

With a sharp knife, make two deep slashes in one side of each fish. Season the inside of the fish and stuff each cavity with a quarter of garlic and two sprigs of rosemary.

Take a roasting dish that’s large enough to hold the fish in a single layer (you don’t want to overcrowd the fish as it will steam rather than roast – use two roasting dishes if you need to). Rub the dish with oil then sprinkle it with salt. Place the fish in the roasting tray with the cut sides facing up. Rub that side of each fish with oil and season with salt.

Place in the oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes. Keep an eye on the flesh visible in the cuts you made – you will see that it turns opaque as it cooks. When there is about half a centimetre left to cook, take the fish out of the oven and allow the residual heat to finish the cooking. This will take 5-10 minutes. The fish won’t go cold, but you could loosely place a piece of foil over the dish if you like.

 Serve each fish on a plate and dress with your best olive oil, a squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt. Serve the dressed courgette alongside"

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, visit:  [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/)

### INGREDIENTS 

* 10 lb pre-cooked ham (approximate weight)
* 4 Tbsp butter
* 1 c brown sugar, packed
* 1/4 c honey
* 1 Tbsp brown mustard
* 1/2 c pineapple juice
* 1/4 c apple juice
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Preheat oven to 325°F.
* Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish, to help keep it juicy.
* If you have a spiral-cut ham, there’s nothing else to do. Otherwise, make 1/4″ deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later).
* Place in the oven and bake.
* A ham will take about 1 to 1-1/2 hours to cook through. After 1 hour, check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F.
* At about the 1-hour mark, start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
* Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. 
* Once the butter has melted, add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
* Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes. 
* Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
* Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F).
* When it’s getting close to that point, but has about a half hour left, baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham. 
* Fifteen minutes later, brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F.
* Serve and enjoy!"

&#x200B;

 

### Ingredients

* 2 sticks unsalted butter room temperature
* ¾ cup packed dark brown sugar
* ¼ cup white sugar
* 1 package (3.4 oz) instant vanilla pudding mix
* 2 eggs beaten
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 ¼ cups AP flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 ½ – 2 cups good quality semi-sweet chocolate chips

### Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, cream together (on low with either a hand or stand mixer) room temperature butter, brown sugar and white sugar. Mixture should be completely homogeneous and smooth.
2. Add in the instant vanilla pudding mix and combine well on low.
3. Add both eggs and the vanilla into the mixing bowl and combine well continuing to incorporate on low. The soft butter should make this dough easy to mix.
4. In a separate mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt until uniform.
5. Slowly add the flour mixture to the large mixing bowl. Continue to mix on low until all the flour is just incorporated. Do not over mix the dough.
6. At this point the dough should be a soft consistency but completely come together.
7. Start with 1 ½ cups of chocolate chips and mix by hand with a spatula until they are dispersed throughout the dough. If desired, add remaining chocolate chips and combine into dough until just together.
8. Cover the large mixing bowl and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
9. While dough is chilling, preheat the oven to 350 F and line 2 baking trays with parchment paper.
10. Two baking trays are useful because you can scoop out cookie dough onto one tray and then put into the oven and then continue with the second tray. You can continue to rotate back and forth.
11. After at least 30 minutes, use a 1 ounce or 1 inch portion of dough and roll into a ball. Place each ball onto the parchment paper lined baking sheet. Set each ball about 1 inch apart (about 12 should fit on 1 baking sheet).
12. Keeping the portions equal in size help them bake evenly.
13. Bake each tray for 10-12 minutes. Cookies should be soft to touch but slightly brown around the edges.
14. When baking, also start with the lower end of the time to ensure the cookies don’t burn.
15. Allow the tray to cool for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.
16. Continue to portion out cookie dough until all the cookie dough is gone. If the cookie dough gets too soft, put back into the refrigerator for 15 minutes until firm.
17. Keep cookies at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

### Notes

* Quality of chocolate matters. Because it is a primary ingredient, spend the extra dollar or two for each package.
* If you don’t want to make all the cookies at once, freeze remaining dough.
* If you make larger cookies, it will affect cooking time, so keep an eye on the cookies."

[Here is an accompanying video for those that like a visual follow along!](https://youtu.be/xDkcmFz-7PU)

# Ingredients

**Pasta:**

* 10 oz medium shells (Undercooked - see step 2)

**Cheese sauce:**

* 45 g Butter (About 2 TBSP)
* 45 g Flour (About 2 TBSP)
* 2 cups 2% Milk
* 1 cup shredded smoked cheddar, add an additional ¼ cup for topping (optional)
* 1 cup shredded colby jack, add an additional ¼ cup for topping (optional)
* 1 TBSP Harissa paste (Or to taste)
* Salt to taste
* Pepper to taste

**Topping:**

To prepare the topping, add the breadcrumbs, 1 serrano, and cooked bacon to a food processor and pulse until a crumbly topping is formed.

# Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees.
2. Boil a pot of water and add 1 TBSP of salt. Add the medium shells and UNDERCOOK them by 3-4 minutes. Example: I cooked the noodles for 7 minutes, when the box said to cook for 11 minutes. The noodles will finish cooking in the oven!
3. Prepare the cheese sauce
   1. Make a roux by melting the butter in a pan over medium heat. Once melted, add equal parts flour and combine until a wet sand mixture forms.
   2. Add the milk and bring to a low simmer, stirring every minute until the mixture has thickened slightly to a buttermilk type consistency.
   3. Stir in both of the cheeses until melted and the mixture has a cheese whiz consistency.
   4. Add the harissa paste in small amounts, adjust to your spice preferences!
   5. Add salt and pepper to taste. Adjust as you taste!
4. Combine the cheese sauce and medium shells until fully coated. At this point the mac and cheese should have a thick, but pourable consistency.
5. Pour the mac and cheese into the greased cast iron pan.
6. Top with the additional ¼ cup cheese
7. Evenly spread the bacon, breadcrumb, and serrano topping over the mac and cheese
8. Cut the additional serrano into quarters and add to the center.
9. Bake in the oven at 450 degrees for 10 minutes, until the topping is crisp!
10. Enjoy!

### Equipment

* Large stockpot
* Large pot
* Sieve
* Whisk

### Ingredients

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* ⅔ cup lard or vegetable oil
* 1 yellow onion
* 5 ribs of celery with leaves
* 2 green bell peppers
* 1 red bell pepper
* 6 scallions
* 6 cloves garlic
* 1 tablespoon Creole seasoning
* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder optional
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 3 pounds shrimp peeled, shells reserved for the stock
* 1 pound andouille sausage sliced into rounds
* 8 cups water plus more if needed

#### For serving:

* Cooked white rice
* Gumbo filé

### Instructions

#### Prepare the holy trinity:

* Before beginning the recipe, prepare all of the ingredients. Reserve any scraps, including onion and garlic paper, the tops and bottoms of the bell peppers, and any root ends from the scallions and celery for the homemade stock. First, peel and dice the onion. Next, trim and slice the celery. Next, trim, deseed, and dice the bell peppers. Transfer the diced onion, peppers, and celery to a large bowl. Trim and mince the scallions and separate the white and green parts. Next, peel and mince the garlic cloves. Keep the white parts of the scallions and the minced garlic together in a bowl. Reserve the green parts of the scallion for serving.

#### Cook the roux:

* Add the flour and oil to a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot and turn the heat to medium. Cook, whisking or stirring regularly, for 20–30 minutes until the roux reaches the color of peanut butter. Next, turn the heat to low and continue stirring for an additional 20–30 minutes until the roux reaches the color of a copper penny.

#### Prepare the shrimp stock:

* Melt the butter into a second large pot. Add the reserved shrimp shells and cook in the hot butter for 1 minute. Add the reserved prep scraps and cover with 8 cups of water and a generous sprinkle of salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer as the roux cooks.

#### Cook the gumbo:

* Once the roux finishes cooking, add the onion, celery, and bell peppers and turn the heat to medium-high. Stir to coat the vegetables with the roux and cook for 5 minutes.
* Add the garlic and white parts of the scallions and cook for 1 minute more. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Add the Creole seasoning and cayenne powder if using.

#### Add the stock:

* Strain the stock through a sieve into a large bowl. Using a ladle, add a few ladles of the stock to the roux and whisk to incorporate. Continue ladling the stock, whisking after each addition, until all the stock has been added—taste and season to your preferences. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for an hour until the vegetables are tender. Taste and season once more. Skim off any foam that floats to the top of the gumbo.

#### Finish the gumbo:

* Add the shrimp and andouille sausage to the pot and cook for 5–10 minutes until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through. Taste and season once more.

#### To serve:

* Serve the gumbo with cooked white rice and garnish with the green parts of the scallions. Sprinkle with gumbo filé and enjoy!

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/n0ices,https://i.redd.it/8iiykmdvuxv61.jpg,reddit,"One of the best parts of this recipe is that it's really versatile. You can make it with turkey, chicken or pork and add any vegetables you like in salads to the bowls. I sometimes add sugar snap peas or steamed edamame. The carrot and daikon pickles are fantastic on sandwiches, as well.

You can find the recipe for the carrot and daikon pickles and more details about the recipe [here](https://nerdswithknives.com/rice-bowls-baked-vietnamese-style-meatballs/).

Ingredients

For the Meatballs:

* 1 pound ground pork or dark meat turkey
* 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish
* 3 scallions white and green parts, minced
* 3 large garlic cloves grated or minced
* 2 tablespoons fish sauce
* 1 tablespoon palm or light brown sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 2 teaspoons finely grated lime zest from 1 lime
* 1/2 tablespoon neutral oil (or use cooking spray)

For the dressing:

* 1/4 cup fish sauce
* 3 tablespoons palm sugar or light brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons lime juice plus more for squeezing
* 1 to 2 teaspoons sambal oelek or chili garlic sauce or more, to taste

For the Bowl:

* 2 to 3 cups cooked rice or other grain of your choice
* 2/3 cup thinly sliced Persian or English cucumber optional
* 1/4 cup thinly sliced radishes optional
* 1/2 cup roasted peanuts chopped

Instructions

1. Heat oven to 375ºF and set a rack in the middle slot. Line a rimmed baking tray with parchment.
2. In a medium bowl, add the pork, 1 tablespoon cold water, cilantro, scallions, garlic, fish sauce, sugar, salt, black pepper and lime zest. Mix with a rubber spatula or your hands until thoroughly combined, then keep vigorously stirring until the mixture turns soft and sticky, about 30 seconds. Using lightly moistened hands, roll the mixture into 1 1/2 tablespoon-sized balls, placing them on the prepared baking sheet. (A portion scoop is helpful but you can also just eye it). You should end up with about 24 balls. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, or up to a day.
3. Remove from the refrigerator, drizzle the meatballs lightly with oil or give them a quick spritz with cooking spray, and bake until meatballs are lightly golden and cooked through, about 15 minutes. If you want them darker, place them under the broiler for a minute or two.
4. Make the dressing while the meatballs are baking. In a small bowl, stir together the fish sauce, sugar, lime juice and sambal oelek.
5. Assemble the bowls with rice, meatballs, carrot and daikon pickles and any extra vegetables. Top with a few cilantro sprigs and some chopped peanuts. Drizzle over a little dressing and serve with extra dressing on the side and a little lime, for squeezing."

**Ingredients:**

* 18 large raw, peeled and deveined, frozen shrimp about 1 pound
* ¾ cup sweetened shredded coconut
* ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs
* ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs beaten
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Dipping sauce to serve like sweet chili

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 400℉. On a baking sheet, mix together coconut and panko. Spread out in a single layer.
2. Toast for 4-6 minutes, tossing halfway through, until golden. Watch carefully! The outer coconut and panko will toast faster than the middle. Once out of the oven, season with salt and pepper, and toss again to distribute the toastier pieces. Set aside.
3. Thaw shrimp by placing them in a colander under cold running water for about 10 minutes, or until thawed. Alternatively, you can soak them in a big bowl of cold water for 20 minutes, dumping out the water and refilling halfway through.
4. Once thawed, pat the shrimp dry as best as possible.
5. Create an assembly line: the shrimp, then a bowl of flour, then a bowl of beaten eggs, then the coconut mixture, and then another baking sheet that’s lightly greased or lined with parchment paper.
6. Take 1 shrimp at a time: dip whole shrimp (but no tail if there is one) in flour and shake off the excess, dip whole shrimp (no tail) in egg and tap off the excess, and then dunk the shrimp in the coconut mixture pressing as much as possible on there. Place coated shrimp on the baking sheet.
7. Continue this process for all of the shrimp, placing them in a single layer (not touching each other) on the baking sheet. Tip: if you’re worried about knowing when the shrimp is cooked through, place 1 shrimp without breading on the baking sheet so you’ll know when it’s pink!
8. Bake at 400℉ for 10 minutes (no need to flip), or until the shrimp itself is pink and the tails curl in a bit. Enjoy with your favorite dipping sauce!"

1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain.
2. In a blender or food processor, combine the whole milk with the green chiles, pickled jalapeños, green onions and garlic powder. Pulse until smooth.
3. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the all-purpose flour; cook 2 minutes more. Add the milk mixture, whisking until it comes to a simmer. Add the cheddar cheese; stir until melted.

Above is the recipe as stated from [this source](https://www.purewow.com/recipes/jalapeno-avocado-mac-and-cheese)

I was excited about the jalapeño/avocado combination, but I have a standard creamy Mac & cheese recipe I’ve been using for years, so I decided to merge the two. Below is what I ended up doing.

&#x200B;

**Ingredients**

**Mac & cheese**

* 1lb conchigliette (mini shell) pasta
* 4 tbsp butter
* 1/4 cup flour
* 4oz can of green chiles
* 2 fresh jalapeños, roughly chopped. (I left the membrane and seeds in because mine is a spicy household, but you can scrape out the interior if you don’t like spice.)
* 5 green onions, roughly chopped
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup milk
* 8 oz ghost pepper cheddar
* 4 oz gruyere
* 4 oz white American cheese
* 2-3oz white Vermont cheddar (the previous three cheeses would have been fine, but I had a bit of extra Vermont cheddar that needed to be used so I threw it in as well.)
* 1 tbsp sodium citrate
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp MSG
* 1/2 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tsp hot sauce

**Topping**

* 2 tbsp butter
* 1/2 cup panko

The directions are basically the same as above. The only alterations are that I added the last five ingredients to the sauce once the cheeses started to melt and thicken. Some people might say the sodium citrate is unnecessary if I’m already adding American cheese, but all I know is that I’ve been tweaking this Mac & cheese recipe for a long time and this combination is perfect for that thick, creamy consistency I love.

Once the pasta was mixed in, I put the combined Mac & cheese in an oven safe dish then topped it with the butter+panko mixture and baked at 375F for about 15 min.

Unfortunately, once I opened one, it turned out my avocados were not yet ripe so I wasn’t even able to use them. Oh well. It was absolutely delicious as is and I’m looking forward to trying it again with avos. It’s a heavy dish so maybe in a month or two.

We also topped it with pulled pork and chopped fresh parsley, basil, and green onion. It’s not nearly as pretty or color corrected as the picture from the original recipe, but here’s the finished result: [link](https://i.imgur.com/ezhGOHz.jpg)

 - Potatoes, peeled and quartered
 - White onions, diced
 - Garlic (optional)
 - Leeks (one leek per 2 large potatoes), chopped
 - Chicken stock
 - Double or whipping cream
 - Black pepper, salt
 - Parsley (optional)
 - Butter (quite a lot)

Boil potatoes until soft (don't drain the water), fry onions and garlic until they start to turn translucent then add to the pot.  
Add leeks, chicken stock, cream, black pepper (lots), butter, parsley in that order and stir well.  
Add salt to taste and stir every 15 mins or so. Use a potato masher to break up the potatoes or a stick/immersion blender.  
Soup is done once it thickens up.  

Notes:
 - You can make croutons by putting a slice of bread in the toaster and use a kitchen knife to slice it up. Sprinkle chives on top of each serving.
 - To make it vegetarian you can skip the chicken stock
 - And if you can't find leeks just add more onions instead
 - The recipe will need different amounts of things depending on the size of your pot, so I intentionally don’t specify them"

I show you as well how to bake them in case you prefer a different texture or want to try the doughnuts without frying.

I did fill my bomboloni with a pastry cream I made at home if you want to try, check out the [recipe here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WcFPKHruy8&t=148s)

Otherwise, you can use some Nutella, jam, etc.

Ok, let's get started then 👨🏻‍🍳

**Ingredients** for Donuts & bomboloni:

300gr flour

4gr salt

60gr butter

24gr fresh yeast

24gr yolk (1 yolk)

90gr egg (2 eggs)

66gr water

45gr sugar

**Step by step:**

1. Mix the yeast with the water.
2. Mix all the ingredients except the butter (flour, salt, sugar, yolk, eggs, water and yeast.) Mix for at least 15 minutes.
3. After that add the cold butter.
4. Give a pair of turns and leave to rest in the freezer for 30 minutes covered with cling film.
5. After 30 minutes, line up your dough at not more than 2 cm and shape your donuts.

**PERSONALIZE:** You can shape like doughnuts or Italian bomboloni. Keep the centre of the doughnuts for mini bomboloni.

**TIP:** Cut the parchment paper in squares and place your doughnuts on top, like this, when you will fry them, they will not get stuck to the tray and they will not lose the shape.

**TIP:** Don't bin the leftovers, but mix the dough and leave it to rest a bit in the freezer. Once it's cold again, you can shape it into more doughnuts.

6. Let them proof for 3hours at room temperature. (Can change depending on your room temperature)

In the mid while, you can prepare some filling. I did a very easy pastry cream or vanilla custard cream you can try following the [recipe here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WcFPKHruy8&t=148s)

7. Time to cook! If you want to bake them, preheat the oven at 180ºC and in more or less 15 minutes they should be ready.

If you want to fry them, use vegetable oil, but careful, don't use it very hot, if you have a thermometer, you can check, the right temperature should be 160ºC. Fry them for about 1 minute, or until they are golden.

8. You can use any glaze, on my video I'm using some caster sugar and cinnamon

9. Once they are ready you can refill them with the cream, chocolate or whatever you like the most. **TIP:** For the baked ones, make a hole before filling them up.

10. Enjoy.

Let me know if you have any questions."

* *1 tablespoon Soy Sauce*
* *2 tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce*

* *1 clove Garlic*
* *2 sprigs Fresh Oregano*
* *1 tablespoon Red Wine Vinegar*
* *1/2 cup Olive oil*
* *black pepper to taste*
* *1/2 teaspoon crushed Red Pepper*

**DIRECTIONS:**

>**Marinate the steak**

1. Place your beef cut in a plastic bag or ziplock and add all marinade ingredients to it. Do not bother premixing it in a bowl – just seal and shake! Place in the fridge for as long as 24 hours prior to cooking.
2. If you don’t have much time to marinate the steak – warm up the marinade in a cooking pan before pouring it into the bag, it will speed up the process. But do not make it too hot, no one likes boiled beef right?  You can let the bag with marinated steak on the countertop cool down then place it in the fridge for 30 min.

>**Chimichurri sauce**

1. For the chimichurri sauce, I use a mortar and a pestle (stone grinding bowl) to mash my garlic with salt. You also can mash garlic with your knife.
2. Mash garlic with a pinch of salt.
3. Add black pepper (I used black peppercorns from my pepper grinder for extra flavor) and crush.
4. Add olive oil and vinegar to mortar and mix well with garlic and pepper mash.
5. Finely chop fresh parsley and oregano.
6. Mix herbs with the rest of the sauce.
7. Add red pepper flakes to taste. I use 1/4 of a teaspoon.

>**Sear the steak**

1. After you let the beef marinate, take it out of the sauce.
2. Place beef on a high heated pan ( I use skillet pan but any type would work, to be honest), and depending on the thickness cook 2 minutes on each side.
3. Let rest for at least 5 minutes.

>**Slice and serve**

1. Slice thin across the beef structure ( basically look for long lines of beef muscle and cut across not along to make the beef taste even softer) and pour chimichurri over it.

Hot & Sour Soup


8 cups of Beef or Chicken Broth (I did 6 cups of beef, 2 of chicken as I ran out)

8 oz baby bella mushrooms, sliced

2 tbsp Rice Vinegar

¼ cup Medium (Low Sodium) Soy Sauce

2 tsp Ground Ginger

1 teaspoon Red Chili Sauce (I used a sriracha by Texas Pete, I don't like the normal green top sriracha)

3 Cloves of minced garlic

½ cup Cornstarch

2 large eggs, whisked

8 ounces firm tofu (cut into cubes or strips, I did a mix of both)

4 green onions (scallions) chopped

Salt & white pepper to taste



Method:

Set aside ¼ cup beef broth

In a large stock pot add 7 ¾ cups of broth, mushrooms, garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, and red chili sauce. Stir to combine and leave to simmer.

Using the ¼ cup of broth, mix in the Cornstarch and stir until fully combined.

Once the main soup has come to a simmer stir in the cornstarch mixture until slightly thickened.

Continue stirring in a circular motion and slowly pour in whisked eggs - I used my  measuring cup for an easy pour.

5. Slowly add in the plain flour, adding it in a bit at a time and whisk into a soft dough.  

6. You will need to rub a little flour to your hands and add a small amount of flour to a clean surface.  

7. Knead the donut dough for a minute and turn it into a dough ball.  

8. Return your dough ball back into the Pyrex bowl and cover for about 20 minutes.  

9. The dough will become bigger in size in this time. To test if your dough is ready poke a few times lightly with your finger, if the dough tries to ping back its ready to be rolled.  

10. Flour a clean surface and rolling pin and roll out your dough so its about 1cm think, if you don’t have a donut cutter use two different size cutters. (you can use a cap from a drinks bottle, it’s the perfect size for the donut holes) . Heat your oil to 170 degrees.  

11. While the oil is heating up leave your donuts to raise again.  

12. When the oil is heated up lower in your donuts carefully into the hot oil.  

13. Do your donuts in batches of two or three at a time depending on the size of you fryer.  

14. The donuts take about 1 minute each side, when one side is done turn over and fry the other side.  

15. When golden brown remove the donuts from the oil and place onto a plate with a couple of squares of kitchen roll, this will help soak up any excess oil.  

16. Place donuts onto a wire rack to finish cooling."

**Cast-iron ribeye recipe:**

1. Season ribeye generously with garlic powder, salt, and freshly ground pepper

2. Heat cast-iron till it’s hot and then add any neutral oil. I used canola 

3. Once pan is hot and smoking, add the steak in and let it sit until properly browned

4. Flip over and add in about 2 tbsp of butter, 3-4 garlic cloves, sprig of rosemary, and some thyme

5. Baste steak with the garlic butter and herb mixture until browned. I cooked mine till is was medium rare, with the ends being a bit more seared.  

6. Remove steak with pan and baste again with the remaining butter and herb mixture. I topped mine with a garlic herb compound butter (1 stick butter softened, 1 ½ tsp lemon juice, 2 cloves garlic minced, 3 tbsp fresh parsley, 1 ½ tbsp chopped rosemary and thyme, and ¼ tsp black pepper)

7. Let steak rest and then slice if you’d like. I prefer mine this way

**Mac and cheese recipe:** 

1. Cook elbow macaroni according to package – amount depends on your preference. Once cooked, drain and set to the side. Reserve a bit of the pasta water.

2. In a saucepan, melt butter and flour over medium heat to make a roux. Add heavy cream to the roux slowly, stirring frequently. I used about 2 cups of heavy cream. Stir until mixture begins to bubble

3. Reduce heat to low and add in 2 cups freshly shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 1 cup shredded mozzarella and stir until melted. Add pasta to the cheese mixture and toss to combine. If too thick, add in a bit of pasta water (optional). If not thick enough, let the macaroni and cheese sit for five minutes to thicken.

4. Top with cracked black pepper to your liking

**Twice baked potato recipe:**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F 

2. Poke 4 russet potatoes with a fork and parboil. Place potatoes on the middle rake and bake until tender, for about 45 minutes to an hour. 

3. Remove the potatoes from the oven and once cool enough to handle, slice of the top layer thinly and scoop out the flesh of each potato into a large bowl. Arrange the shells upright on a baking sheet and set them aside.

4. Mash the potatoes until smooth and then mix together cheddar, garlic powder, onion powder, heavy whipping cream, and salt and pepper to taste. 

5. Put the shells of the potatoes in a oven-safe dish and spoon the potato mixture inside carefully. Top with more cheddar cheese and put them in the oven until the cheese is bubbly and brown

Lastly, top everything with parsley because it’s the best!"

I used a Thai/Chinese shiitake mushroom which are meatier than the more delicate shiitake caps. If using shiitakes with thinner caps, adjust cooking time as needed as they have the propensity to dry out quickly.

* 1 pound ground chicken
* 2 eggs
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled
* 4 Thai chili peppers, trimmed
* 3 scallions, scrubbed and trimmed, divided
* 1 shallot, peeled
* 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste
* ½–¾ cup panko or plain breadcrumbs
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and caps sliced

2. Place the garlic, Thai chili peppers, shallot, and 2 scallions in a food processor and pulse until minced.
3. Add the minced aromatics to the chicken along with lemongrass paste. Use your hands to combine. Add ½ cup panko or breadcrumbs and mix to combine. If the mixture is too wet, add an additional ¼ cup of breadcrumbs. Mix until combined and let stand 10 minutes.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat in a wide pot. Add a teaspoon of the meatball mixture and fry until cooked through. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.

**Fry the meatballs:**

1. Form the mixture into meatballs and fry for 3–4 minutes per side until browned all over. They need not be cooked through. Transfer to a plate.

**Cook the mushrooms and onions:**

1. If the pot seems dry, add another tiny drizzle of oil. Add the onions and mushrooms and cook for 7–8 minutes. Stir the mushrooms regularly and continue cooking until they brown around the edges. Season with salt.

**Sizzle the paste:**

1. Add the green curry paste and let it sizzle in the pot for 30 seconds. Toss to coat the mushrooms and onions in the paste. Pour in the water or broth.

**Simmer the meatballs:**

1. Add the chicken meatballs to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 25 minutes or until meatballs reach 165ºF. Taste and season the broth to your preferences.

**Finish the broth:**

1. Mince the remaining 1 scallion, keeping the white and green parts separate.
2. Stir the coconut milk and white parts of the scallion into the broth. Simmer 5 minutes.

**To serve:**

(mint topping optional) Has there ever been a more perfect combination than chocolate and mint? No, there’s not. Smooth rich chocolate combined with refreshing mint is just delectable…oh, and then I decided to throw in some Oreos too for the crust.

Recipe at: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/mint-chocolate-ganache-cheesecake/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/mint-chocolate-ganache-cheesecake/)

Full recipe, more detailed instructions, and video tutorial at link above.

## Ingredients

## Ingredients for Chocolate Ganache Cheesecake

* 32 oz cream cheese, softened to room temp
* 1 c granulated sugar
* 10 oz bittersweet chocolate
* 1/4 c cocoa
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 4 large eggs
* 1/2 Tbsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 c heavy cream

## Ingredients for Oreo Crust

* 1 pkg Mint Oreo cookie wafers
* 1/2 c butter

## Ingredients for Mint Topping

* Cream filling from pkg of Mint Oreos
* 1 c heavy cream
* 1/2 Tbsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 c granulated sugar

## Instructions

## Making the Crust:

* Preheat oven to 325℉
* Separate cream filling from cookie, for the entire package of Mint Oreos, and put in two separate bowls. Place all cookie wafers into a food processor and blend until fine crumbs…or roll them with a rolling pin. 
* Melt ½ cup of butter. In a bowl, pour melted butter over cookie crumbs, and mix together using a fork until the cookies and butter stick together a bit.
* Grease the bottom and sides of a springform pan with butter and press the crust mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove crust from oven and let cool.

## Making the Cheesecake:

* Melt the chocolate. You can either do this in a bowl in the microwave at 15-second increments or melt it over a double boiler. To melt the chocolate using the double-boiler method, place a pot in the stove, containing about 1 inch of water, and bring to a simmer. Place the chips in a metal bowl and, wearing oven mitts, hold it over top of the pot with the simmering water, stirring frequently, until the chocolate has melted. Let the melted chocolate cool a little before moving on to the next step.
* Using a hand mixer or KitchenAid stand mixer with whisk attachment, blend together softened cream cheese, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla. 
* Add melted chocolate, cocoa, and heavy cream, and mix until all ingredients are well blended and thickened. Pour this mixture into the crust and smooth the top so it’s level. Yes, it is thick! 
* Bake at 325℉ for 60-70 minutes.

## Make Mint Topping:

* Again, using your mixer, whisk together heavy cream, sugar, vanilla, and cream filling from all Mint Oreos, and mix until firm peaks.
* Once the cheesecake is finished baking, let it rest on the counter to cool for at least 1 hour. After it has cooled, remove the ring from the springform pan and spread the mint topping over the entire top of the cake.
* Place your finished cheesecake in the fridge and allow to set overnight.  Enjoy!"

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNjFzm_5dW0&&list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&index=2&t=0s) and [enhanced instructions](https://madewithlau.com/recipes/taro-cake) (with embedded videos, adjustable serving sizes, unit conversions for ingredients.)

**𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙎𝙏𝙊𝙍𝙔**

I've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.

**𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙍𝙀𝘾𝙄𝙋𝙀**

* Prep Time: 35 min
* Total Time: 3 hours
* Yield: 4 servings

𝙄𝙉𝙂𝙍𝙀𝘿𝙄𝙀𝙉𝙏𝙎

Main Ingredients

* 1.5 lb taro
* 0.50 lb regular rice flour
* 1.5 cups water (for flour mix)
* 0.50 oz dried shrimp
* 1 lap cheung (chinese sausage)
* 0.25 oz ginger (only a little bit needed)
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 whole piece green onion
* 1.5 cups boiled water (for cooking taro)
* boiled water (about 3-5 cups, enough to fill the wok until water touches the bottom of the plate)
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil

Additional Flavors

* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp chicken bouillon
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* white pepper (to taste)

𝙄𝙉𝙎𝙏𝙍𝙐𝘾𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉𝙎

**STEP 1 - WASH AND REHYDRATE DRIED SHRIMP**

Wash and rehydrate the dried shrimp (0.50 oz). In a bowl, wash the shrimp in warm water for a few seconds and drain the bowl. Pour hot water into the bowl, and let the shrimp rehydrate for 5-10 minutes. The shrimp should be soft and tender to the touch when rehydrated.

**STEP 2 - CHOP INGREDIENTS**

Chop our lap cheung (1), ginger (0.25 oz), garlic (2 cloves), green onion (1 whole piece). For the lap cheung, cut off a few coin-sized slices as garnish for later, and cut the rest into small pieces. Mince the ginger and garlic, and chop the green onion into small pieces. When the dried shrimp is fully rehydrated, chop the shrimp into very fine pieces.

**STEP 3 - CUT TARO**

Precautions: wear food-safe gloves and place a hand towel underneath our cutting board.

* Cut off the end of the taro root
* Cut off the amount of taro (1.5 lb) necessary, using a food scale to verify
* Cut away at the perimeter to remove the skin, and wash with cold water
* Cut the taro into slices, strips, and finally, peanut-sized cubes

**STEP 4 - HEAT WOK, PREPARE FLOUR**

Set the stove to its highest heat setting, and heat the wok for 3-5 minutes as we prepare our regular ice flour (0.50 lb). Using a food scale, weigh out the rice flour into a bowl, add water (1.5 cups), and mix together for 30-60 seconds.

**STEP 5 - COOK GARLIC, GINGER, SHRIMP, LAP CHEUNG**

After the wok is hot enough (you should see it releasing a tiny amount of smoke), add vegetable oil (1 tbsp) and mix it around the surface of the wok.

We'll be cooking our garlic, ginger, shrimp, and lap cheung for about 2 minutes in total. Gradually add each ingredient, stirring constantly:

* Add garlic and ginger, cook for 20 seconds
* Add shrimp, cook for 40-50 seconds
* Add lap cheung, cook for 45-60 seconds

The goal is to release the flavors and aromas before we add the taro.

**STEP 6 - BOIL WATER, START COOKING TARO**

Before we add the taro, start boiling water - enough water for the taro (1.5 cups) + enough water to minimally submerge the plate in the wok as it sits on top of the steamer rack.

Pour the taro into the wok, and stir it around for a minute so that it absorbs the flavors of the garlic, ginger, shrimp, and lap cheung.

**STEP 7 - ADD FLAVORS TO WOK**

Add salt (1 tsp), sugar (1 tsp), chicken bouillon (1 tsp), and oyster sauce (1 tbsp) to the wok, and stir it around for another minute.

**STEP 8 - ADD WATER, COVER THE WOK, BRING TO BOIL**

Pour the boiled water (1.5 cups) into the wok, stir for a few seconds, and cover the wok until it starts boiling again (about 2-3 minutes.)

**STEP 9 - COAT PLATE WITH OIL**

Coat the plate that you'll be using with a little bit of vegetable oil. This is so that when we're done cooking, the taro cake won't stick to the plate.

**STEP 10 - UNCOVER WOK, ADD FLOUR MIX, SESAME OIL**

When boiling, uncover the wok. Sample the taste of your taro, and adjust if necessary. Stir the flour mixture for a few seconds and pour it into the wok, as well as sesame oil (1 tsp). Stir the wok around for about 90 seconds, so that the flour and taro are evenly mixed together.

**STEP 11 - TRANSFER TO PLATE, SMOOTH OUT THE CAKE**

Scoop out the taro cake mixture into the plate you oiled earlier, and smooth out the surface of the cake so it's flat. Wash the wok before we start steaming.

**STEP 12 - START STEAMING THE TARO CAKE**

Place a steamer rack in the wok, and add enough boiling water to the wok so that when the plate sits on top of the rack, the water is just touching the bottom of the plate.

Place the plate of taro cake onto the steamer rack, cover the wok, and steam for about 20-25 minutes.

The thickness of the plate affects the time we need to steam the cake for. If we're using a thicker plate (as shown in the video), we need to steam for 3-5 minutes longer than we would if we were using a thinner or metallic plate.

**STEP 13 - UNCOVER WOK, ADD GARNISH, AND COOL**

Once the 20-25 minutes is up, let's uncover the wok. To check if the taro cake is ready, poke it with chopsticks. If it's not ready, the cake will stick to the chopsticks.

Carefully take the plate out of the wok, and add the coins of lap cheung and green onion for garnish.

Let the taro cake cool at room temperature for a few hours.

Let the taro cake cool at room temperature for a few hours. If you want to speed up the cooling, place the taro cake on a bed of ice.

**STEP 14 - SLICE THE TARO CAKE, PAN FRY**

After the taro cake is cooled, you're ready to cut it.

If you'd like to make it even more tasty, add oil to a pan, and pan fry the slices of taro cake for 3-5 minutes on each side.

Call over your loved ones, and enjoy :)"
https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ndtjg5,https://i.redd.it/ak962niiriz61.jpg,reddit,"I have seen these bars go by a few different names but growing up we always called them “Sweet & Salty Bars”. They were one of my absolute favorite desserts as a kid and I would get so excited when my grandmother would prepare them for me! I think they may even be the first dessert I ever learned how to make. They are ALWAYS a hit wherever I take them and friends who have tried them beg me to make them again.

# Ingredients

* 40 to 50 saltine crackers
* 8 tbsp margarine (1 stick), see note
* 8 tbsp butter (1 stick), see note
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1 package dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips (10-12 oz)
* Flakey sea salt or slivered nuts (optional, for topping)

# Notes

* If made with two sticks of butter the bars will turn out brittle like toffee. If made with two sticks of margarine the bars will be VERY gooey, even straight from the freezer. ½ margarine & ½ butter results in a texture I strongly prefer over either on its own.

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425° F.
2. Line a large Jelly Roll pan with aluminum foil, spray with nonstick spray and arrange the saltines salt-side down in a single layer. Break some crackers into smaller pieces to fill in the edges as needed
3. Melt together the butter and margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Once melted add the brown sugar. Cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture is bubbling all over and turns a caramel color. Allow the mixture to boil for about a minute, then remove from heat (be careful to ensure it doesn’t boil over).
4. Mix well then pour the mixture over the crackers, covering them as evenly as possible. Put the jelly-roll pan into the oven and bake until the mixture begins to bubble, about 3 minutes. Very carefully remove the pan from the oven, taking care to keep it level (it can easily spill).
5. Set the pan down on a heat proof flat surface. Use a butter knife or spatula to re-level any overlapping crackers back into a single layer. Once the mixture has stopped bubbling scatter the chocolate chips evenly over the top. The chips will take a few minutes to melt completely (they may appear too sparse at first but don’t worry, it always looks this way). Spread them as they melt to form an even layer of chocolate on top.
6. Optionally, top with flakey sea salt or slivered nuts.
7. Transfer the pan to the freezer or fridge and chill until completely cooled (I use the freezer). Once fully chilled, remove from the freezer and peel off the aluminum foil. Break the bars up into pieces (it’s okay if the size varies piece to piece). This step can be a bit messy, especially if the bars are not fully cooled.
8. Store in an airtight container between layers of wax paper in the fridge or freezer. They stay fresh for about a week in the fridge or a few months in the freezer.

I could only post one pic here but there’s more photos and progress pics on my Instagram: [@CraftyCookbook](https://instagram.com/craftycookbook?igshid=et7z4gbq8uva)

Edit to say you can eat these basically straight out of the freezer (I usually let them sit for ~3 mins first) so it’s a great thing to make if you live alone or want a dessert that lasts awhile!"

I've made this a few times for parties, and it's always a major hit. It's soooo rich and creamy and works really well with the spiced carnitas on top. I think it'd make a great football Sunday recipe!

This is definitely a labor of love and takes a while to make, but most of the time is inactive. When I made it for my family, my dad added chopped bacon, and I liked it, so I included it in the recipe. You can skip the effort if you want since bacon doesn't usually go in carnitas, lol, but it does add a nice lil crunch

NOTE: For the carnitas, I use a spice blend that is tons of Mexican chilies, cinnamon, cumin, sugar, and garlic. Most carnitas recipes will have you season the pork with Mexican oregano and cumin and will sometimes throw in a bit of cloves depending on the recipe. I recommend using your favorite storebought Mexican spice blend, or you can make a Carnitas blend with the following:

* 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder

**Carnitas:**

* 3 pounds boneless pork shoulder
* 2 tablespoons of your favorite store-bought or homemade spice blend \*see note\*
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 grapefruit or 2 navel oranges, juiced
* 6 slices bacon, optional
* Salt and pepper
* Water

**Mac and Cheese:**

* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1/3 cup flour
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup whole milk
* Pinch of ground white pepper, optional
* Cayenne powder to taste
* 1 8-ounce block mild cheddar cheese, shredded
* 1 8-ounce block sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
* 16 ounces elbows or shell-shaped pasta
* Salt to taste

**Brown the pork shoulder:**

1. Pat the pork dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Sprinkle one side with 1 tablespoon of the spice blend use your hands to rub it all over. Flip and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of the spice blend and rub until the shoulder is completely coated with the blend.
2. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the pork and cook without moving for 3–4 minutes until a golden crust begins to form. Flip and cook for 3–4 minutes per side until it is seared on all sides.
3. Add the onion, bay leaves, and grapefruit juice. Pour in enough water to fully cover the pork. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.

**Simmer the pork:**

1. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 3 hours. Remove the lid and simmer, uncovered, for 30–45 minutes to reduce the liquid. Taste and season. The pork should be very tender. At this point, you can let it cool and refrigerate overnight, or you can continue with the recipe as is. I find refrigerating makes it easier to remove the fat. This recipe assumes it has been refrigerated overnight.

**Shred the pork:**

1. Using a spoon, remove the fat layer from the top of the pork. Remove the pork from the pot and shred it with your fingers or two forks. If there are large pieces of fat, you can discard them.

**Finish the pork:**

1. Return the pork to the pot and transfer to the stovetop over medium heat. Let it bubble–uncovered–until all the liquid evaporates. Toward the end of this process, be sure to stir regularly and adjust the heat as needed to prevent the pork from sticking.

**Cook the bacon (optional):**

1. As the pork finishes cooking, place the bacon in a cold skillet and turn the heat to medium. Cook, occasionally turning, until all the fat is rendered and the bacon is very crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Once the bacon is cool enough to handle, dice it or crumble it into small pieces.

**Broil the pork:**

1. Mix the crumbled bacon in with the shredded pork.
2. Turn on the broiler. Arrange the pork on a baking sheet. Transfer to the broiler for 3–4 minutes until crispy edges begin to form on top. Remove from the broiler and cover with foil.
3. *Note: At this point, I recommend washing out the pot used for the pork and reusing it for the mac and cheese.*

**Start the mac and cheese:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Combine the milk and cream in a large measuring glass.
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until 1 minute under al dente. Drain and set aside.

**Prepare the béchamel:**

1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once bubbly and frothy, add the flour and stir regularly for 3–4 minutes until it turns golden and takes on a nutty aroma.
2. Turn the heat to medium-low. Add 1/4 of the cream and milk mixture to the flour and whisk constantly until a slurry forms. Cook for 1 minute. Add another 1/4 of the mixture and whisk it vigorously until combined. Continue adding the milk and cream mixture in increments, whisking after each addition until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season the sauce with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of cayenne powder to taste.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Turn the heat to low. Stir a handful of the shredded cheese and stir until melted. Continue adding the cheese in increments until all of the mild and sharp cheeses have been fully incorporated and melted. If it’s too thick, whisk in a splash of milk or cream. Taste and season.
2. Add the cooked pasta to the cheese sauce and toss to coat. Turn off the heat.

**Bake the carnitas mac and cheese:**

1. Add half of the mac and cheese to a large baking dish. Add half of the carnitas and toss to coat. Pour the remaining mac and cheese into the dish. Scatter the remaining carnitas on top. Transfer to the preheated oven for 5–10 minutes until the cheese sauce is bubbly and the carnitas are warmed through again.

**To serve:**

1. Serve with a sprinkle of chili flakes on top if you like. Enjoy!"

Ingredients

For Filling:

3 lb. ground beef

1 large onion, chopped

3 small garlic cloves, finely minced

3 tbsp. butter, cut up

½ cup water

2 tsp. Beef Bone concentrate (image below).

2 tsp. Chicken Bone concentrate (image below).

2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce

2 tsp. White vinegar

1+ tsp. black pepper (to taste)

1 + tsp. regular table salt (to taste)

½ tsp of Morton’s seasoning blend (image below).

½ + tsp. Garlic powder (to taste)

1  head cabbage chopped

1 tsp. brown sugar

2 ½ cups (a couple Tblsp. per roll) of shredded mozzarella or cheese blend of your choice, optional.

*One 3 lb. bag of 36 Rhodes Frozen Dinner Rolls (2 rolls will make one Bierock). You can also use the Texas rolls which are larger and you’ll only need to use one per bierock. Or if all you have is a loaf of their frozen bread dough that will work too cutting each loaf into 8 slices.

1 stick butter, melted

Instructions

*The night before, place frozen rolls in sprayed glass pans and wrap each tightly with plastic wrap that is also sprayed. Place into fridge to thaw overnight. 

When you are ready to start cooking your filling pull the rolls out of the fridge so they can finish doubling in size while you start cooking your filling.  Preheat oven to 350°F.

In a large frying pan, brown ground beef and onion until done, breaking up into small pieces. Drain any excess grease if necessary. Place ground beef back into your skillet and add garlic, and sauté 1 minute longer. 

Add butter, water, both bone broths, worcestershire, vinegar, black pepper, salt, garlic powder and Morton’s blend. Add shredded cabbage stirring well to mix. Cook over medium-low heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is very tender. Should take 15 – 20 minutes. During the last 5 minutes, add brown sugar stirring well and remove from heat.  You can make this ahead of time and hold for 1 – 2 days.

Spray 2 baking sheets with non-stick spray.

Grab two rolls and keep the rest wrapped so they don’t dry out.  Combining two rolls pressing out the dough kind of like making a pizza into a 5-6 inch round circles or rectangles or whatever shape you are capable of pulling off. Spreading them on a dry counter can help with this. Oil or flour will make it impossible so keep your counter clean. Try to make edges thinner so you don’t end up with a big clump of bread in the center once they are baked. 

Place about 2 tablespoons of shredded cheese in the center, then top with a generous scoop ( about ⅓-½  cup) of the meat mixture. You don’t want your rolls understuffed. Bring up the sides, a bit at a time, pulling up and over the top, overlapping with each pull. Kind of like if you were making a Chinese dumpling. Pinch a little to seal, and place seam side down onto your prepared baking pan. Brush with melted butter. Continue with rest of rolls.

When 6 are filled and ready to go: Cover the prepared bierocks with plastic wrap or a clean lint free kitchen towel and let them proof (rise) for about 20-30 minutes. Bake for 25 – 30 minutes or until golden brown. Make sure the bottom is done. Nobody likes a soggy bottom. Place on a cooling rack. Brush with melted butter if desired. Bake next tray when the first one are done. I usually use the first sheet pan for the last batch. You can crowd them more tightly if you like, but I don’t like them to touch and they do expand being a yeast dough.

Serve with your favorite side such as fries, chips, or a cucumber onion salad. I like to dip mine into a little yellow mustard and ketchup on the side. Most in my family eat them plain while others are known to enjoy them with spicy brown mustard. "

Here is a [video](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CL3_CjiJ4kz/?igshid=1ezre6u5j2rhe) of the cooking process (NB if you don't have Instagram give me a shout and I can upload to imgur). Otherwise below are detailed steps on how to make this dish. I've also included some notes on substitutes and optional ingredients.

**INSTRUCTIONS** 

- Mix marinate ingredients together into a smooth mixture, marinate chicken for 30 mins, set aside.
- Mix sauce ingredients together, set aside.
- Add oil to a wok or large frying pan and heat until it shimmers (about 350f), then fry cashews for about 1 minute until golden brown then remove with a slotted spoon onto some kitchen roll. 
- In the same oil, fry chillies for about 30-45 seconds until just beginning to brown - again remove with slotted spoon and set aside.
- Flour the chicken, then fry it in the same oil for about 3-4mins until cooked through - remove with slotted spoon and set aside.
- Remove all but 1 tbs of oil from your wok, then over med-high heat stir fry garlic and onion for about 1 minute before adding back in your chicken, chillies, cashews.
- Add sauce mixture and stir fry for about 2 mins until sauce has reduced slightly and is forming a glossy coating over everything. 
- Add julienned chillies and spring onions, give everything a good mix to incorporate.

**TO SERVE**

- This dish is best served with fresh jasmine rice. 
- A cold beer is also a good pairing!

**NOTES**

- Dried birdseyes will make this dish very, very hot - they are completely optional but if you like spice I recommend adding them in!
- For the julienned fresh chillies, I use large green and red chillies that are mild in terms of spice (jalapenos / cayenne / arbol would all be decent options) - if you can't find large fresh chillies using just red and green peppers will do
- Rice flour can be used as an alternative to AP flour"

**Ingredients**

* 1 tbsp espresso powder
* 2 tbsp water hot or boiling
* 1/2 cup butter unsalted, melted
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup sugar granulated
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 3/4 cup flour all-purpose

* 3/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 cup chocolate chunks divided

**Instructions**

* Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly spray a 9×9"" cake pan with cooking spray and line it with a sheet or parchment paper, with excess hanging over the edge.
* Whisk the espresso powder with the hot water until completely dissolved. Add the butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and prepared espresso to a large mixing bowl and beat until the sugar is mostly dissolved.
* Sift the flour, powdered sugar, cocoa, and salt into the bowl. Whisk until just combined, then use a spatula to fold the remaining dry ingredients in. Fold in 3/4 cup of the chocolate chunks.

From: https://www.thespeltkitchen.com/chocolate-honeycomb-aka-cinder-toffee/


INGREDIENTS

200g white sugar

4 tablespoons golden syrup (see notes)

1 tablespoon bicarbonate (baking soda)

200g milk chocolate


INSTRUCTIONS

Prepare a fairly deep tin/pan by lining it with baking paper.

In a heavy bottomed pan, add the sugar and syrup and heat on a medium temperature until the sugar starts to melt.

Stir often, making sure the mixture doesn't stick, and continue to cook until it changes to a darker brown colour (this should take around 6-8 minutes but watch it carefully because it is very easy to burn).

Remove from the heat and then quickly add the baking soda, whisking it in to the hot mixture, then pour into the prepared pan/tin. Move fast because the sugar mixture starts to harden almost immediately.

Set to one side until it has hardened completely (about 30 minutes).

In the meantime, melt the chocolate and then pour over the hardened honeycomb. Allow the chocolate to set (it doesn't need to be in the fridge unless you are in a hurry).

When ready, break or cut into shards. The pictures in this post show very large pieces for photographic purposes which were broken into smaller pieces before eating.


NOTES

Golden syrup is something commonly used in the UK. Sources tell me that it is available in the US and Canada and can be found in the International aisles (Lyles is the brand). That said, any golden-coloured syrup should work in this recipe.

Some people have reported that the cinder toffee has overflowed. Therefore, make sure you use a fairly deep dish (mine is 5cm in depth)."

 3. Perform stretch & folds, pulling all sides of the dough over itself for 2 full rotations. Let it rest again for 15 minutes & repeat this process. Once completed let your dough rest for an additional 30 minutes.

 4. Roll your dough into a 30 cm (12 in) tube & then cut it into 12 individual slices. Shape those pieces into small boules & then let them rest overnight in the fridge(Skip if Baking Powder was used) covered in a bowl with a damp cloth. When that is done, roll them out into flat spheres & stripe them using the blunt side of a knife.

 5. Cook your waffles on a greased or non-stick pan at low heat for 2 minutes on each side.

 6. To make your Caramel Syrup, measure out its 4 ingredients in advance. Begin melting your sugar in a pot at low heat, followed by your butter; when that has melted pour in your heavy cream as well as salt. Stir those ingredients by using the handle to manipulate your pot & let it cook for 2 additional minutes before letting it cool for 10 minutes. Exercise caution when working with Caramel.

 7. Cut your waffles into circular shapes using a cookie cutter or large mug & then spread your syrup on one of its face. Tightly sandwich that with another waffle to complete the recipe.

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jkhtr6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jkhtr6,reddit,"This is a stew that was taught to me by a Czech mother, so I’d like to thank her, wherever she may be. Very rainy where I am today, and this just made the house feel so comfortable.

The main goal of this stew is to fully develop the flavor of a few pieces of ham with some onions and spice, then use that to pair with the richness of potatoes and cream. The dill is the star, bringing earthy freshness that makes everything not feel so heavy. This dish does best with a good balance of those three. I don’t measure anything, so I’m hoping that my estimations will yield the same results.

Yields about 4-5 bowls.

Ingredients:
5 baseball-sized golden potatoes

1 bunch of dill

1/2 lb (8 ounces) of sliced ham

16 ounces of chicken broth

16 ounces of heavy cream

3 tbs of dried onions

1 tbs of butter

1 tbs of olive oil

1 tbs of all purpose flour

2 tsps of red pepper flakes or smoked paprika

1 tsp of chicken bouillon (optional)

1 tsp of garlic powder

1 tsp of black pepper

Salt to taste

Directions:

1. Dice potatoes into large chunks. Size is a preference.

2. Using a skillet, heat olive oil on medium heat, until glistening. Add ham and slowly roast until browned, just slightly on the edges, for some color and texture.

3. Add dried onions, red pepper/paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper. Stir into ham and roast the spices, until fragrant.

4. Add 1/2 cup of chicken broth at a time. Allow to heat before adding more, stirring each time in order to distribute flavor. Move on to the next step, continuing to add until all the broth is gone.

5. Heat an 8 quart pot on medium heat. Add butter until melted and beginning to brown.

6. Add flour and whisk until smooth in texture. If you have difficulty with lumps, then carefully add olive oil until smoothed.  Cold butter will not help. Continue heating until edges begin to simmer.

7. Whisk in heavy cream slowly, trying to maintain constant temperature. Each time you notice bubbling, to indicate that the mix is heated, add more cream until bubbling stop. The mixture should be slightly fragrant.

8. Once all cream and broth are mixed into their respective bases, turn off heat, pour the broth/ham contents of the skillet into the cream of the pot. Stir to combine.

9. Return the heat to low. Add the diced potatoes. Covering is optional. Let simmer for one hour.

10. After an hour, a mixture of fat and starch will flow to the top. Feel free to remove this. I don’t think this adds any extra flavor here, but instead can leave the mouth feeling kind of gross. Best to remove and may be an excellent base to a poutine gravy.

11. Finely chop some dill ends, serve soup in bowls, and garnish with as much dill as you prefer. This is a strong herb and should be to one’s individual tastes.


Hope you all enjoy this as much as me. I try to feed this to everyone that I love. I hope you love this as much as me."

### INGREDIENTS

* 1.5 pounds thick pork belly (about 1.5 inches wide; skin on)
* 3 cups water
* 2 cloves garlic (crushed)
* 1/2 inch ginger (sliced thin)
* 2 star anise
* 10 Szechuan peppercorn (optional if can’t find at grocery store)
* 1/2 cinnamon stick
* 2 tablespoons cooking oil
* 7 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 4 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)

### DIRECTIONS

* In a wide pot or pan, add the three cups of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (the water level should be at least half the thickness of the pork belly). Add the pork belly and parboil for a minute on each side, just until the exterior is a bit firm. Remove the pork belly to a cutting board, and set the hot water aside (don’t pour it out!)
* Add the garlic, ginger, star anise, Szechuan peppercorn, and cinnamon stick to the water and keep over low heat (we need this water to be hot since we will be adding it back to the pork and if it gets cold then it might cause the meat to toughen up)
* Cut the pork belly into cubes about 1.5 inches on each side
* In a Dutch oven or large pot, start heating up the oil over medium-low heat. Add 3.5 tablespoons of the brown sugar. Let the sugar sit undisturbed until you see it start to melt. Once it starts melting, you can use a single chopstick to mix it up a bit to speed up the melting process
* When all the sugar has melted and turned into a dark amber color, add the pork belly. Cook while flipping the pieces for a few minutes until almost every side of each piece is covered with the caramel. Be gentle so you don’t break the pieces!
* Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine and cook for a minute. Then add the water with all the spices and aromatics. Braise the pork belly over medium-low heat for 2 hours, stirring once every 30 minutes
* After 2 hours, the pork should be fully tender. You can check by sticking a chopstick into the meat through the bottom. The chopstick should be able to easily pierce the entire piece. If you want it to be more tender, put the lid back on and keep braising until it reaches your desired tenderness
* Remove the lid and raise the heat to medium. Add the remaining 3.5 tablespoons of sugar and mix. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced significantly and thickened up. Stir every few minutes to prevent the meat from burning. You’ll know it’s done when the sauce is thick enough to start sticking to the meat
* Remove the meat from the pot and then drizzle with some of the extra sauce. Serve hot with a side of rice and vegetables

* 2000g beef brisket
* 500g yellow potatoes
* 55g broad bean paste
* 30g yellow soybean paste
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 5g star anise
* 2g Sichuan peppercorns
* 2 bay leaves
* 60g green onions
* 60g ginger
* 60g garlic
* 3g salt
* 5g MSG
* 2g sugar
* 5g black pepper
* 1000g water

# Directions

 

1.         Prepare the beef brisket: Cut them into uniformly sized pieces.

2.         Prepare the yellow potatoes: Cut into roll-cut pieces, making sure not to soak them for too long to avoid losing starch, which affects the texture.

3.         Prepare the green onions, ginger, and garlic: Set aside.

4.         Blanch the beef: Place the beef pieces in cold water in a pot. If the beef is fresh, there is no need to add green onions, ginger, or cooking wine. After the water boils, skim off the scum. If scum continues to appear, add a couple of spoons of cold water and bring to a boil again to skim off the scum. This process may need to be repeated three times, depending on the quality of the beef, until the water is clear. Remove the beef from the pot.

5.         Fry the beef: Heat oil in a pan, add two slices of ginger, and stir-fry briefly before adding the blanched beef. Continue stir-frying until there is no moisture at the bottom of the pan, then remove the beef and transfer it to a pressure cooker.

6.         Prepare the sauce: Reheat oil in the pan, add green onions, ginger, and garlic to fry until fragrant, followed by the bay leaves, star anise, and cinnamon. Continue to fry until aromatic, then add the broad bean paste and fry until fragrant before adding the yellow soybean paste.

7.         Cook the sauce: Add water to the pan, cook for a moment, add dark soy sauce for coloring, and season with black pepper.

8.         Stew the beef: After bringing the sauce to a boil, pour into the pressure cooker with the beef. Cover and after the pressure cooker reaches pressure, stew for 25 minutes. If you do not have a pressure cooker, stew slowly for at least 1 hour, depending on the size of the beef pieces, the quality of the beef, and the cooking temperature at home.

9.         Add the potatoes: After the beef is tender, add the potatoes, place at the bottom of the pot, and cook on low heat for 5 minutes.

10.     Serve: When the beef is tender and coated with sauce and the potatoes are soft, the dish is ready to be served."

100g or 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter, soft.

50g or 1/2 cup Sugar

150g or 1 cup + 2 tbsp All Purpose/Plain Flour

**Caramel Filling:**

200g or 2/3 cup Condensed Milk

150g or 2/3 cup Unsalted Butter

50g or 1/2 cup Sugar

50g or 3 tbsp Golden Syrup, can also use Honey or Maple Syrup

**Chocolate Topping:**

200g or 1 cup Chocolate Chips/Squares

**Prep:**

1. Preheat oven to 350F/175C. Line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper and grease the sides with butter.

2. In a bowl, beat sugar and butter to form a smooth paste. Add flour and gently mix it all together. Use your hands to knead and mop up all the crumbs.

3. Flatten crust inside pan and try to level it as much as you can. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until your crust is a light golden brown around the edges. Let it cool in the pan.

4. While your crust is baking, start the caramel. Put all filling ingredients into a saucepan and place on medium-high heat, stirring gently. Watch it closely as you stir. If you see little brown slivers at the bottom of the pan, stir them in vigorously and turn the heat down to a low-medium. Simmer it gently until it reaches a deep, golden brown color. It should take around 15 minutes.  

5. When ready, pour the caramel over the cooled biscuit crust and spread evenly using an offset spatula or knife. Let this cool for at least an hour. You don’t want the caramel to be warm or it’ll ruin your chocolate. Don’t cool in the fridge or else you’ll end up with a hard mess. 

6. Melt chocolate using microwave or double boiler and pour over cooled caramel to finish off.

7. To serve, heat up a knife using hot water (make sure you dry it) or a blowtorch. This will ensure you get a nice clean cut. Cut into whatever size slices you want; I usually go for 1-inch squares.

**Ingredients for the filling:**

* 400g (14.1oz) pork mince 10% fat
* 400g (14.1oz) Nappa cabbage (1 medium)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 40g (1.3oz) piece of ginger, minced
* 2 spring onions thinly sliced
* 2tbsp soy sauce
* 1tbsp Mirin or Sake
* 1/4tsp of salt
* 1/2 tsp of sugar
* 1tsp of black pepper

**Ingredients for the dough:**

* 300g (10.6oz) plain flour
* 150 (0.16 quarts) water room temp.
* 3g (0.1oz) of salt.

**Ingredients for the sauce:**

* 50ml (3tbsp) of sweet soy sauce (use half if using standard soy sauce)
* 75ml (5tbsp) of sweet chilli sauce
* few drops of lime juice

**Method:**

1. Begin by making dough, combine all the ingredients until dough ball forms. Rest it under the bowl or clingfilm for about 15 minutes to relax the gluten. 
2. In the meantime chop the cabbage finely and mix with 1/4tsp of salt leave it in the bowl for around 10-15 minutes.
3. Come back to your dough and kneed it with your hands for about 8 minutes or until nice and smooth. Cover and rest for another 30 minutes.
4. Now you can finish your filling, mix pork mince with garlic, ginger, spring onions add all the seasoning. Add cabbage but make sure you squeeze it out of the water first.
5. Cut the dough in four, take one part and keep the rest covered to prevent it from drying out. Roll the dough until 2,5mm (0.1inch) thick on a lightly floured surface (the dough needs to be thick enough to not break and hold the liquid inside that comes out of the meat).
6. Use a round cutter or the glass 8cm (3inch) in diameter to cut the dough. Place a small ball of meat in the middle and crimp the edges ( you can use some water to help it glue together). Place ready-made dumplings on the cloth to prevent them from sticking and cover with another one to stop them from drying. Repeat until all dumplings are made.
7. Boil dumplings in the water in small batches for about 5 minutes ( you can do a test one to adjust the timings). They usually start to float at the top when ready.
8. Once boiled you can pan fry them with a little bit of oil to make them more crunchy, serve with the chilli soy sauce. Enjoy!"

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 35-40 minutes

#Ingredients for Seared Scallops in a Creamy Lemon Caper Sauce with Orzo

**SEARED SCALLOPS**

1 pound large, dry sea scallops, muscle removed

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 tablespoon butter

Salt and pepper to taste

**CREAMY LEMON CAPER SAUCE WITH ORZO**

16 ounces orzo

1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

5 cloves garlic

3 anchovy filets

1 3.5-ounce jar nonpareil capers, drained and rinsed

1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, more or less to taste

¼ cup fresh flat leaf parsley

½ cup white wine (or use no sodium chicken stock)

1 cup heavy cream

1 large lemon

Salt and pepper to taste

#Method

Prepare Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the orzo until al dente. Reserve ¼ cup pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain and rinse the orzo and toss with 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil. Set aside.

Prepare Ingredients: Zest 1½ teaspoons lemon zest and then juice the lemon. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Combine the chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon lemon zest (reserve remaining zest for garnish), anchovies, crushed red pepper, and drained capers in a bowl and toss to combine. Mince the parsley.

Prepare the Seared Scallops: Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium high until very hot. Pat the scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. Sear for about 1-2 minutes until very well browned and seared. Flip and cook an additional minute or so until just cooked through and opaque. Transfer the cooked scallops to a plate and tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Blot out most of the excess oil from the skillet.

Prepare the Creamy Lemon Caper Sauce: Return the skillet to medium high heat. Add the bowl with the garlic and capers and sauté for 5 minutes, mashing the anchovies until they’ve ‘melted’. Add the parsley and cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and white wine and bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 5-6 minutes until reduced slightly. Add the heavy cream and reserved pasta cooking water and stir to combine, and turn the heat to medium. Taste and season to your preferences. Once bubbly and thickened slightly, add the orzo and toss to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes more or until the orzo is warmed. Turn off the heat.

To Serve: Divide the orzo with creamy lemon caper sauce between bowls and arrange scallops on top of each dish. Garnish with a bit of lemon zest on each dish, a crack of fresh black pepper, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (optional). Enjoy!"

Have you ever wondered what Dan Dan means? It sounds cute, but this name actually refers to a type of carrying pole that was used by vendors who sell food on the street. Some decades ago, street food vendors in the Chinese province of Sichuan carried the pole over the shoulder, with two baskets, one containing noodles and the other containing sauce attached at either end. In this way, they could lower the cost and make the food very affordable. In Chinese, this pole is called Bian Dan (扁担), so the local people gradually came to call them Dan Dan noodles.

Pork:

\- 200g 70-80% lean ground pork

\- 100g preserved vegetables (Yibin ya cai)

\- 2 tbsps (30ml) Chinese cooking wine

\- 1 tbsp (15ml) soy sauce

\- 2 tsps (10ml) dark soy sauce

Noodles:

\- 200g all-purpose flour

\- 2g salt

\- 80-85ml water

Sauce:

\- 1 tsp black vinegar

\- 1 tsp soy sauce

\- 2 tsps chili oil

\- 1g sugar

\- 1 tsp sesame sauce (sesame paste & sesame oil in 1:1 ratio)

\- a pinch of Sichuan peppercorn powder (optional)

\- chopped green onions

&#x200B;

**Directions:**

Meat and Veggies:

1. Use medium to high heat, wait for the pan to become hot, add 2 tbsps oil, stir fry the pork until the color turns white.
2. Add 2 tbsps of Chinese cooking wine, stir fry the pork until the water evaporates. Add the preserved vegetables and stir fry everything together for about 1 min. Add 1 tbsp of soy sauce and 2 tsps (10ml) of dark soy sauce, keep stir frying it until there is no more liquid in the pan.
3. Chop the scallions and make the sesame sauce (sesame paste & sesame oil in 1:1 ratio).

Noodles:

1. Dandan noodles are deliberately a little chewy, so the ratio of the flour and water is about 1 : 0.4.
2. Mix the flour, salt, and water together, make sure there is no dry ingredients left in the bowl. Cover it and let it rest for 20 min.
3. Divide the dough into three pieces, take one piece, press down on the dough to roughly flatten it. I then used a manual pasta maker to make the skinny noodles. Run the dough through the pasta maker starting from the thickest setting. Adjust the knob on the side and make the dough thinner and thinner until the setting is at number 5. Dust some flour on top of the dough, so when you cut the dough into noodles, they won't stick together.
4. Boil the noodles for 1 min.

Assembling the bowl:

1. Add the black vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame sauce, a pinch of sugar, and a pinch of Sichuan peppercorn powder in the bowl.
2. Add 1 oz of the noodle soup along with the noodles. Add the cooked meat and scallions. Mix well and slurp it up!"

This skewer is a classic korean street food that I used to eat a lot growing up in Korea. A crispy, chewy, spicy, and sweet snack thats perfect whenever. They are super easy to make too!

**Ingredients:**

* Korean Rice Cakes
* Skewer Sticks
* cooking oil
* sesame seeds (garnish)

**Sauce Ingredient:**

* 1 tbs sugar
* 1.5 tbs ketchup
* 1 tbs soy sauce
* 2 tbs corn syrup or 1 tbs honey
* 1 tbs minced garlic
* 1 tbs gochujang (red pepper paste)

**Recipe:**

Rehydrate dried rice cake by soaking in water. Skip this step if using fresh rice cakes.

1. Mix sauce ingredients and set aside
2. Blanch rice cakes for 30 seconds, 45 seconds for really thick ones like the one you see in the video.
3. Skewer rice cakes with a stick, make sure they are completely dry before cooking.
4. Heat oil in medium heat and fry rice cakes until nicely browned on each side, then take off pan and coat with sauce.
5. Lower heat and fry again each side for a few seconds, make sure not to burn the sauce too much.
6. Garnish with sesame seeds.

**Tips:**

* Frying the rice cakes again in sauce is actually optional. It can be eaten right after coated.
* If rice cakes crack when skewering, it means it did not rehydrate long enough, I suggest blanching again for another 15-30 seconds.
* You want to completely dry the rice cakes before frying because they tend to absorb some water. Water + oil = danger

*for the dressing:*

* 1 shallot, minced
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 2 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 6 tbsp olive oil

*for the tuna:*

* 6oz tuna
* 1 tsp coarse sea salt
* 1 tsp coarse fresh ground black pepper

*other toppings:*

* eggs, soft-boiled
* green bean, poached
* baby red potato, cooked
* kalamata olives
* heirloom cherry tomatoes, halved

Serve on lettuce of your choice!

**Instruction:**

Start by boiling the eggs as this will take the longest; about 7\~8  minutes.

Meanwhile,  start cooking the potatoes. Cut baby potatoes in halves (or  regular  potatoes into bite size). Microwave covered for 3\~4 minutes,  until fork   tender.

While your potatoes and  eggs are cooking, poach your  green beans. Into salted boiling water,  add the green beans and poach  for a minute or two, just until the color  turns bright green. Strain  them out and chill them in iced water. This  will help preserving the  bright green color.

Chill cooked  potatoes in cold water. Give it a toss to wash off the surface  starch.

Dunk the cooked eggs in cold water. Peel both eggs and set aside.

Make  the dressing in a jar. Add chopped shallot, lemon juice, dijon mustard,  fresh ground pepper, salt, and sugar.  Shake it up until mixed, and add  olive oil. Give this another shake,  and you're done. The whole process  should take less than 30 seconds.

Make  the dry rub for  the tuna. Mix coarse sea salt with fresh ground  black  pepper. Dust the mix on a flat surface, and  coat the tuna steak in the  salt and pepper rub. Make sure you get all  sides of the tuna steak.  sear each side for about 10\~15 seconds.

Assemble  the salad. Start  with a bed of green leaves, add the cooked eggs,  potatoes, green beans, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, and seared  tuna. Drizzle the dressing  over everything. Enjoy!

Storytime: the first time I made this soup is when I was like 13. It’s my dad’s recipe, and he told me “JUST ONE CUP OF ELBOWS” before he left for work, but me being the lil carb monster that I am decided that he was wrong and added the whole box. And that’s how I’ll never live down the cement soup tragedy where we couldn’t even get the spoon out of the pot.

Anyway, this vegan version is much better than my first attempt 20 years ago! Usually, my dad would make it with potatoes, mushrooms, heavy cream, and elbows. To get big flavor + creaminess without the dairy, I roasted celery first and then blended it with potatoes and some of the soup liquid and added it back to the soup. The finished product was SO good, and it's such a great, cheap recipe to throw together.

**INGREDIENTS:**

* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 stalk of celery (about 10 ribs), root part trimmed off and discarded
* 1 pound of Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
* 5 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 7 cups water or vegetable stock
* 1 cup elbow pasta
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving, optional:**

* Paprika or chile flakes
* Fresh dill or parsley
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil

**METHOD:**

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.

**Roast the celery:**

1. Cut the celery into thirds and arrange on a baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven for 30 minutes.

**Cook the mushrooms and potatoes:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the potatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt, and pepper, and add the dry thyme. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.

**Blend the potatoes and celery:**

1. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, scoop out half them from the pot and transfer them to a food processor. Add roasted celery and a few spoonfuls of the hot broth and blend until puréed.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring the soup back to a boil. Add the elbows and puréed celery and potatoes and cook until the pasta is al dente. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with dill, silk chili, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like. Enjoy!"

 9. After the steamer is on steam, pour in the coconut sugar batter as the first layer, and steam for 5 minutes on medium heat. Remember to stir the batter before pouring it in.
 10. After the first layer is steamed, pour in coconut milk batter as the second layer and steam for 5 minutes on medium heat. Remember to stir the batter before pouring it in.
 11. The steaming time and temperature may need to be adjusted as the kuih level gets higher. After each layer is evaporated and solidified, a matte surface will appear.
 12. Repeat this operation until the ninth layer of coconut sugar. The last layer needs to be steamed for 10 minutes on medium heat to make sure it be cooked.
 13. After steaming, take it out and let it cool. If you are in a hurry to demould and slice, you can soak the mold in ice water. But make sure that the mold is seamless.

* 2 tablespoons salted butter
* 4 cloves garlic, finely diced
* 21 oz (600 g) mushrooms, washed and dried with paper      towel (I used Cremini)
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1/2 cup white wine, (OPTIONAL) (I substituted with      chicken broth)
* 5 oz (150 g) jarred sun dried tomato strips in oil, (reserve      1 tablespoon of the jarred oil for cooking)
* 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
* Salt and pepper, to taste (I did not add any salt or      pepper)
* 3 cups baby spinach leaves, washed
* 1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch, OPTIONAL — (mix cornstarch with      1 tablespoon water for a thicker sauce.
* 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs
* 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (I used dried      parsley)

**Instructions**

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt the butter and sauté onion until transparent; add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about one minute). Cook the sun dried tomatoes and oil in with the butter for about 2 minutes to release all of their flavours. Cook mushrooms in the tomato flavours for about 5 minutes.

2. Pour in the white wine or broth (if using), and allow to reduce to half, while scraping any bits off of the bottom of the pan. (SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU WISH.)

3. Reduce heat to low-medium heat, add the cream and bring to a gentle simmer, while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.

4. Add in the spinach leaves; allow to wilt in the sauce, then add in the parmesan cheese. Allow sauce to simmer for a further minute until cheese melts through the sauce. (For a thicker sauce, add the milk/cornstarch mixture to the center of the pan, and continue to simmer while quickly stirring the mixture through until the sauce thickens.)

5. Mix in the herbs and garnish with parsley. 

6. Serve over mashed cauliflower, zucchini noodles or steamed veg. Alternatively, serve over pasta, mashed potatoes or rice.

Now that I’ve made this dish, I think boiling some gnocchi and adding it in at the end would be amazing. The sauce would also be great for dipping some fresh bread in."

This is for a 5-ingredient project that I'm testing recipes for so that's why the ingredients are sparse! You can definitely add to this recipe. Garlic, spinach, kale, or cherry tomatoes would be great additions! If you eat meat, you can also add a protein like sweet Italian sausage or grilled chicken.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
* 1 cup loosely packed basil, divided
* 8 ounces plant-based or dairy cream cheese
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (or basil-flavored oil)
* 16 ounces paccheri or rigatoni
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Roughly chop the basil and set it aside.
2. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 25–30 minutes until caramelized. Stir regularly and adjust the heat as needed to prevent the onions from burning. Season with salt and pepper.
3. As the onion cooks, combine the cream cheese and half the basil in a food processor. Pulse until completely blended. Add water, as needed, in tablespoon increments until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You will likely need 2–3 tablespoons of water total. Season with salt, to taste.
4. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the paccheri and cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set it aside.
5. Add the pasta cooking water to the caramelized onions and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes or until the liquid reduces by half. Add the remaining basil and the pasta and cook for an additional minute or two. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn off the heat.
6. Spoon the basil cream onto plates and smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Pile the pasta on top of the cream and serve with a few additional basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like. Enjoy!"

&#x200B;

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Boil the rice in plenty of water (should cover the rice by 2 inches)
2. Heat up the fresh milk over medium-high heat, keep stirring and don't scorch it
3. Stir in the vanilla aroma and sugar into the hot milk
4. Strain the boiled rice and add it into the hot milk
5. Reduce heat and let simmer for 10 minutes, in order for the rice to soak in some milk
6. Pre-heat oven to 180°C/356°F in ""Grill Mode""
7. Egg-yolk and starch will serve as a thickener: mix both with 50ml of milk in a separate bowl
8. Once the milk and rice simmered for 10 minutes, increase the heat to high and once the milk starts boiling, add the thickener (spoon by spoon)
9. The milk should thicken after a few minutes of boiling and stirring
10. Add the butter into the milk, which will add more taste and help our Turkish rice pudding to get a nicer crust
11. Turn off the stove once the butter is fully melted and evenly distribute the pudding mix into oven-proof forms, which are at least 3cm/1.2inch in height
12. Place the forms on a baking sheet, pour water on the baking sheet (should cover forms at half height)
13. Insert the baking sheet on top level and let the rice pudding bake/grill in the oven for a few minutes
14. Monitor the process, and be aware that not all puddings’ tops will be burned evenly. Get your Turkish rice puddings out, once as many as possible got a nice dark brown crust.
15. Sprinkle with crushed hazelnut and enjoy!

What's interesting it first originated from Japanese manga ""Cooking Papa."" In the comic book, Papa is the guy working for corporation but a secretly amazing cook that lies to his colleagues telling them that all the outstanding food that he brings to work is made by his loving wife but she, in fact, is useless in the kitchen :)

It is super fun to make this and I love the delicate flavours that come through together!

📷📷

**Ingredients for 4 sandwiches:**

* 8 Sushi Nori Seaweed Square Sheets (Best way to buy in bulk on Amazon)
* 350g (12.3oz) of Sushi Rice cooked and seasoned
* 8 Ladyfingers - Okra, blanched in hot water for 1 minute
* 100g smoked tofu, pan-fried and glazed with soy sauce
* Mixed salad (beetroot, spinach)
* 1 Avocado sliced
* 1 small carrot  cut into matchsticks
* Half red pepper cut into matchsticks
* Japanese mayo
* Soy sauce
* Nigella seeds for garnish
* Plastic Wrap
* Small round dish or metal ring **(11.5cm in diameter and 5cm tall) (4,5 inch /2 inches)** to assemble (I used one of my small serving pie dishes and it worked great)

**Instructions for the small dish method:**

**1.** Cut a piece of plastic wrap bigger than a sheet of seaweed (It helps to hold everything in the shape) and place inside the dish.

**2.** Place a square of the seaweed inside the dish to fill its shape.

📷

**3.** Place a layer of rice at the bottom of the seaweed (use a small amount of water on your fingers to prevent the rice from sticking)

**4.** Create the mirror layers of your fillings with the main item in the middle finishing with rice layer at the top (push the layers down to compress and keep in mind where the cut will be) You can also drizzle some soy sauce inside the layers.

**5.** Remove from the dish by lifting the plastic wrap and cover the top with another piece of seaweed (big enough to overlap slightly on the previous seaweed)

**6.** Wrap tightly in the plastic wrap to hold the shape then cut.

**7.** Enjoy with a drizzle of Japanese Mayonaise!

 **Insight:**  


* I found it easier to work with seaweed that was soggier. Take a few sheets out the packet and leave them on the counter overnight.

INGREDIENTS:

* *Donuts dough:*
* 500 gr flour
* 200 ml warm milk
* 70 gr butter (room temperature)
* 2 large eggs (room temperature)
* 10 gr dry yeast
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* *Topping:*
* 100 gr dark chocolate
* 100 gr dark chocolate
* 200 gr heavy cream or heavy whipping cream

## INSTRUCTIONS:

## DONUTS:

In a small bowl, mix the yeast with a little bit of warm water to dissolve it.

Put the flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the center then add: the yeast mixture, eggs, vanilla extract, salt, butter and mix using a spoon or your hands. Add the milk little at a time, then knead the dough for several minutes until it is soft and detaches from the sides of the bowl. Cover with a towel and let it rise for at least 1 hour.

Flour a work surface to roll out the dough, then using a glass or round cutter, cut out donuts. Cover with a towel and set aside for another 30 minutes.

Fry your donuts in heated vegetable or any other frying oil and set in a blotting paper to absorb oil.

## TOPPING:

I choose to top my donuts with white chocolate ganache, and dark chocolate ganache.

In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it barely begins to simmer. In the meantime, place each chocolate separately in a heat proof bowl after chopping it (the smaller the chocolate pieces are the easier it is to melt). When the cream starts to simmer, pour half of it in each chocolate bowl, let it sit for 2 minutes then stir very slowly until well combined.

Dip the donuts in one of the ganaches, sprinkle with anything you have, like m&ms or any small candies.

Let the donuts dry for 1 hour before tasting."

**Directions**

1. To quick-pickle a shallot, start by trimming off its stem, then peeling it (while keeping it whole). Slice it across its width into thin rings, then place the rings in a shallow bowl. Cover with vinegar and a generous pinch of salt, give it a little stir to combine, and leave it to sit at room temperature for 15-30 minutes (or until the vinegar has taken on a pinkish hue and the shallot rings have started to turn translucent). Any leftovers can be stored along with the brine in a jar or container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
2. Remove the stems from your cherries, then halve and pit them.
3. Cut your cucumber diagonally into medium-thick slices.
4. Arrange the cherries and cucumber on the serving plate, along with the basil, burrata and quick-pickled shallot.
5. Dress the salad with the sherry vinegar and salt first, then the olive oil and pepper.

Enjoy!

**Notes:** If you don’t have any sherry vinegar on hand, balsamic vinegar makes a fine substitute. If you're looking for some golden crunch, salty pan-fried cubes of sourdough or fried slices of halloumi make good croutons. And, if like me you’re a visual learner in the kitchen, [feel free to watch this salad being made right over here](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17946098123124920/)."

This easy creamy chicken gnocchi soup is probably my new favorite chicken soup recipe. It’s really easy to prepare and easy to customize based on the ingredients you have on hand. Replace the onions with leeks, the peppers with eggplant, and the carrots and parsnips with any other root vegetable you might have.

If you want to use fresh chicken instead of a rotisserie chicken, you can boil boneless skinless thighs or breasts in the broth and then shred them before adding back to the soup. If you want to save time, rotisserie is the way to go.

If you don’t have gnocchi, you can use a small pasta, such as orzo or ditalini and simple adjust the cook time as necessary.

#Grade

Serves: 6

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 60 minutes (30 minutes inactive)

#Ingredients for Easy Creamy Chicken Gnocchi Soup

1 rotisserie chicken

2 tablespoons butter

1 large yellow onion

4 cloves garlic

1 red bell pepper

4 carrots

2 parsnips

6-7 cups of low-sodium chicken stock

1 teaspoon dry thyme

1 teaspoon paprika

Crushed red pepper to taste

Salt and pepper to taste

16 ounces gnocchi

½ cup heavy cream

½ cup fresh parsley leaves

1 lemon

Extra virgin olive oil, optional, for garnish

#Method

**Prepare Ingredients:**
Pick the meat from the rotisserie chicken and discard the skin and carcass. Peel and small dice the onion. Trim the red bell pepper and dice. Peel and mince the garlic. Peel the carrots and parsnips and cut into rounds. Chop the parsley leaves. Juice the lemon.

**Prepare the Soup Base:**
In a soup pot, heat the butter over medium hot until melted and frothy. Add the onion and red bell pepper and cook, stirring often, until softened and well-browned, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.

Add the shredded chicken and toss to combine. Cook until the chicken begins to brown slightly, about 4 minutes.

Pour in the chicken stock and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Add the carrots and parsnips. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, paprika, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until the carrots and parsnips are fork tender.

**Cook the Gnocchi:**
Turn the soup back to a low boil and add the gnocchi. Cook for 1-3 minutes or until all the gnocchi begin to float and are soft and tender. Turn off the heat.

**Finish the Soup:**
Pour in the heavy cream, lemon juice, and all but a pinch or two of fresh parsley leaves. Cook for 1-2 more minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Do not overcook.

**To Serve the Creamy Chicken Soup:**
Ladle the chicken gnocchi soup into bowls and garnish each bowl with the reserved chopped parsley leaves. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!"

Recipe lightly modified from here: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs\_85851](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs_85851)

**Ingredients:**

For the sausage meat:

\- 1lb lean minced pork

\- 20g Stuffing Mix (Bland as possible so American style preferably. I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper

\- 2 tsp fresh thyme

\- 1 tsp parsley flakes

\- 1 tsp sage

\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped

&#x200B;

For the scotch eggs:

\- 6 medium eggs

\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper

\- 1 egg beaten

\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs

\- vegetable oil, for frying

&#x200B;

**Method**

\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.

\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)

\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.

\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \~1/4"" thick.

\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.

\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.

\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)

\- The eggs will be cooked for \~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.

\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.

\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  


  
**Improvements**  
This is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor."

Dry marigold flowers add a tangy sharpness to this tortellini in marigold broth, so we soften it with butter and cream.

I researched and saw that marigolds are also known as “poor man’s saffron” so I immediately thought of something that would highlight the nice yellow colors.

Since I have never cooked with them before, I kept this recipe very simple. The base is a simple stock: marigold petals, shallots, lemon, garlic, white wine, and stock. It simmers for about 30 minutes and then the stock is strained and the solids are discarded. From there, I just emulsified butter into the stock over low heat, added cream, chopped asparagus, and cooked tortellini.

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 55 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 629kcal

* Bring the broth to a boil and reduce heat. Stir in the cream and cook for 5 minutes until thickened slightly.
* Add the asparagus and cook for 3-5 minutes or until bright green and tender-crisp. Add the cooked tortellini and turn off the heat.

* 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 2 fennel bulbs
* 1/2 cup Castelvetrano olives or other green or black olives
* 2 tsp fennel seeds, slightly crushed
* 2 tsp cumin seeds, slightly crushed or 1 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp ground pepper
* 1 lemon

# Instructions

   1. Preheat your oven to 425°F. Prepare a large baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or lightly greasing it with olive oil.
   2. Cut the fennel bulbs in quarters, remove the core and cut into thick slices. Place in a large bowl and toss with 1 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.
   3. In a small bowl, combine 2 tbsp olive oil, lightly crushed fennel and cumin seeds, turmeric, salt and pepper.
   4. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and rub them with the spice mix on both sides. Place on the prepared baking sheet, skin side up.
   5. Spread the fennel around the chicken thighs on the baking sheet, ensuring everything is in a single layer.
   6. Transfer the baking sheet to the preheated oven and roast for 20 minutes.
   7. Remove from the oven and scatter the olives around the chicken.
   8. Return baking sheet to oven. Continue roasting until chicken is fully cooked, skin is crisp and fennel is tender, 15 to 20 minutes more.
   9. Once done, remove the sheet pan from the oven and squeeze the lemon over chicken, olives and fennel. Serve warm, pouring pan juices over the chicken.

# Notes

* Refrigeration: Allow the cooked chicken and vegetables to cool completely before transferring them to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.
* Reheating: Reheat in a 350°F oven for 20 minutes, covered with aluminum foil to prevent drying out. You can also reheat individual portions in the microwave on a microwave-safe plate covered with a microwave lid.
* To cut down on calories and saturated fat, simply refrain from consuming the skin."

The pudding is of course, as per the title, an eggless version, therefore there is no baking involved. The pudding is set by the agar-agar and the custard powder (which you can get in most supermarkets these days). The texture is really smooth and it's basically a near fool proof recipe.

If you're interested in a video format, The link to the video is [her](https://youtu.be/M2_UU4Hqxv0).

\- Agar - Agar Powder 1 tsp

\- Rose Essence 1/2 tsp

\- Custard Powder 1 tbsp

\- Saffron Strands (Optional)

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ld5jet,https://i.redd.it/vjuiqrqicnf61.jpg,reddit,"I thought it would be cool to make a very traditional Ragu alla Bolognese; i.e. the sauce that was the catalyst for the famed 'Spaghetti Bolognese' dish a lot of us know and love. This dish is said to have originated in Italy's Bologna region hence the name. For anyone interested it was Pelligrino Artusi who first published ragu as a recipe back in 1891.   
  
The below recipe is just for the ragu sauce - it will make enough to top 6 servings of pasta. Best pasta to serve this with is tagliatelle, fettucine, or pappardelle. 

Prep Time: 30 minutes

Cook Time: 3+ hours

Total Time: Approx 6 hours

Servings: 6

##### EQUIPMENT

- Saucepan

##### INGREDIENTS

• 250g beef, hand minced (chuck, brisket, short rib, shank all work)⁣  
• 250g pork, hand minced (shoulder is best)⁣  
• Extra Virgin Olive Oil⁣ (EVOO)  
• 1 onion, diced⁣  
• 1 rib celery, diced⁣  
• 1 carrot, diced⁣  
• 2.5 tbs tomato paste (concentrated)⁣  
• 1 cup red wine⁣  
• 1 cup stock (chicken or beef) + more for topping up ⁣  
• 1 cup whole milk⁣  
• 1 cinnamon stick⁣  
• 1 bay leaf⁣

• a largish segment of lemon peel⁣  
• A little pinch of nutmeg⁣  
• Salt & black pepper to taste

##### INSTRUCTIONS

- Use a sharp knife or a heavy cleaver to finely chop the meat into a course mince.
- Heat a heavy bottomed pot on high-heat add enough EVOO to cover the bottom about 1/4 inch thick then add beef and saute for 6-7 minutes until browned on the outside. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon ensuring you leave rendered fat in the pot and set aside.
- Repeat the above step for the pork.
- Add onions, carrot, celery and saute for 15 - 20 minutes.
- Add red wine, then the beef and pork back in, then tomato paste, stock, milk, cinnammon, bay leaf, nutmeg, lemon peel. Give everything a good stir and season with salt (about 1 tbs) and black pepper
- Simmer on low heat for 3-6 hours - taste every half an hour; if it gets dry top up with either water or stock. It's done when the meat is tender and no longer chewy; obviously the longer you cook the more tender/melt in your mouth it will get. 

##### TO SERVE

- Tagliatelle Egg Pasta (cook according to packet instructions and add as much ragu as you like and a dash of reserved pasta water to make it a little saucy) 
- Grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese 
- Cracked Black pepper 
- Glass of Red Wine!

Servings: 4

# Ingredients

* 400 g kale (if you find cavolo nero, even better; substitute with the same amount)
* 5 garlic cloves, peeled
* 100 g parmesan cheese, grated
* 240 g beans (borlotti, red kidney, or cannellini beans are good options; you can use canned beans or cook from dried - in this case start from 120 g dry weight)
* 400 g pasta (for example, penne)
* 4 eggs
* Red chilli flakes (optional topping)
* Olive oil (optional topping)

# Method

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
2. Shred the cabbage into small pieces. For smoother results, separate the stalk from the leafy parts (see the end of the post for the method) and cut it into pieces (\~ 5 cm long).
3. Lightly salt the boiling water and add the cabbage stalks and 4 of the garlic cloves. Cook for 5 min.
4. Then, add the leaves. Cook for 5 min more.
5. With a slotted spoon, remove the cabbage and the garlic (this way you can use the same water for boiling the pasta).
6. Add some more salt to the water and boil the pasta according to the package instructions. Before draining, reserve some of the pasta water.
7. Meanwhile, add the wilted cabbage and garlic (including the one left raw) to a blender. Blend while adding some of the pasta water, until it becomes smooth and pourable (a bit thinner than the final texture, as you will still add the cheese).
8. Let the mixture cool down for a bit. Then, add the parmesan cheese and mix.
9. Transfer part of the sauce to a large bowl and add the cooked pasta and the drained beans. Add more sauce to your desired amount. If necessary, add some more pasta water to thin the sauce and allow it to better coat the pasta. Note: You can save any leftover sauce in the fridge to add to another batch of pasta, beans, or whatever you fancy.
10. Fry an egg per portion and add on top of the pasta. Finish with some red chilli flakes and a drizzle of good olive oil."

* For greasing each pan: ½ tablespoon melted butter, 1 teaspoon all purpose flour
* 90g (¾ cup) all purpose flour
* 50g (½ cup) finely ground hazelnut
* ¾ tsp baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 90g (½ cup) caster sugar
* 45g (3 tablespoon) milk
* 25g (2½ tablespoon) maple syrup
* 145g (⅔ cup / 11 tablespoons) unsalted butter, browned and kept warm

**Directions**

1. Grease a 12-hole madeleine tray with melted butter and lightly flour pan with all-purpose flour. Tip pan over sink and tap side of pan to knock out extra flour.
2. In a medium bowl, sift all purpose flour, ground hazelnut, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
3. Brown butter in a saucepan until it smells nutty and has turned amber. Set aside.
4. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar with an electric whisk, for about 5 minutes on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale, thick and doubled in volume.
5. Fold the flour mixture from step #2 into the egg mixture from step #4. Add milk and maple syrup and mix.
6. Pour warm brown butter and mix until fully incorporated.
7. Spoon half the batter into the prepared madeleine tray (each hole should be half-full). Cover with cling film and refrigerate overnight. Transfer remaining madeleine batter into a container and cover batter with cling film, pressing to the top of the batter to prevent batter drying out.
8. The next day, preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F). Bake madeleines for 10 minutes until lightly golden and firm to touch.
9. Remove from oven and leave to cool for 5 minutes before gently removing from pan (I find using a fork or small offset spatula really helpful).

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/f0n6wk,https://i.imgur.com/UijRPKc.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients: 

6 drumsticks 

3 cups of rice

3 cloves of minced garlic

1/4 of a sweet onion

Broccoli (optional) 

Cajun seasoning or salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder

2 chicken bouillon cubes

Fresh parsley for garnishing

Instructions: 
Take your desired number of drumsticks and clean them and remove the scales. Season the drumsticks liberally with a Cajun spice or salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. Do no hesitate to season liberally. Cook the drumsticks in a cast iron skillet for a few minutes on each side in hot vegetable oil. Remove the chicken and place on the side.

In the same skillet cook about 1/4 of a sweet onion until translucent. Add 3 cloves of minced garlic and if you desire broccoli or similar vegetable. Do not cook long enough that the garlic burns. 

Now add 3 cups of rice or 3 single bags of rice directly to the skillet. Let the rice roast for a few minutes in the onion, garlic, and vegetable. After a few minutes add equal parts water to the skillet (cups of rice=cups of water) and reseason the mixture with the same seasonings as the chicken drumsticks. Again feel free to be liberal and make a nice top layer over the water before stirring. Just be careful with how much salt, the rest of the seasonings will be good. At this point it should look quite soupy, like a stew. Add 2 chicken bouillon cubes and let them dissolve. Once they have dissolved remove from heat and add the drumsticks to the ""stew"" and make sure they are fully submerged or as close as possible. Cover the skillet with foil and place in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, uncover it and replace in the oven for 15 more minutes. You can also check to make sure top isn't burning and the middle is properly cooked. Remove from the oven and garish with fresh parsley. I made this recently and it was so easy and delicious, I got lots of compliments on the dish. The chicken is so tender and flavorful.

Edit: as one redditor pointed out, if you wish to make this a truly Cajun dish then complete the holy trinity with bell pepper and celery in addition to the onion (no broccoli)."

Original recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/healthy-takeout-style-velvet-chicken/](https://craftycookbook.com/healthy-takeout-style-velvet-chicken/) 

Time: 30 mins

Please note, there are multiple methods for ""velveting"" chicken, which tenderizes the meat. This method uses baking soda. This process is optional but recommended. 

**Ingredients**

* 1 lbs chicken breast
* 3 cups broccoli florets
* 1 8oz can of water chestnuts, drained and rinsed (optional)
* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* salt
* fresh cracked black pepper

*For Sauce:*

* ½ cup chicken broth, can sub water
* 2 tbsp mirin, Japanese sweet cooking wine
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 2 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic

**Instructions**

1. Slice the chicken breast into \~¼” thick slices. Arrange the sliced chicken on a cutting board or plate so it’s laying flat. Dust with 1 tsp of baking soda, then flip all the pieces and dust with the other 1 tsp of baking soda. Let sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, rinse the baking soda off of the chicken with water then thoroughly pat dry (This is what tenderizes the chicken and gives it the unique texture). Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.
2. While waiting on the chicken, mix together the chicken stock and cornstarch in small bowl, then add in the other sauce ingredients and mix well. The oyster sauce may not fully incorporate, that’s okay it will in the pan.
3. Once the chicken is prepared, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and try to arrange it such that the pieces lay flat in the pan. Cook until golden on one side (2-3 minutes), then mix the chicken around in the pan and cook until cooked through (another \~90 seconds).
4. Push the chicken to the sides of the pan and add the broccoli to the center. Cook for about one minute, then add the water chestnuts and cook for another minute. Add more oil to the pan if needed.
5. Next, lower the heat slightly and add the sauce. Cook everything together for another \~2 minutes until the sauce has reduced and evenly coated everything. Remove from heat and add in the chopped green onion, serve immediately over a bed of white rice.

**Ingredients for Broth**

* 4cm chunk of ginger, cut into thick slices
* 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
* 2 green onions, only the white parts
* 2 dried shiitake mushrooms
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp fish sauce
* 1 tsp white vinegar
* A small pinch of white pepper
* 2 whole star anise
* 1 liter chicken or veggie stock

**Ingredients for Wonton (makes around 20\*)**

* 20 wonton wrappers
* 200g ground pork or chicken
* 100g peeled and deveined shrimp, roughly chopped
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced
* 1 garlic clove, grated
* 1 tsp grated ginger
* ¼ tsp black or white pepper
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp oyster sauce
* ¼ tsp sugar
* 1 tsp cornstarch

**Ingredients for Noodle Soup**

* 2 portions egg noodles of your choice
* 1 head of baby bok choy
* 10 wontons
* Enoki mushrooms, 50g (optional)
* Cooked corn, ½ cup (optional)
* Sesame oil

**Toppings & garnishes**

* Green onion
* Sesame seeds
* Chilli oil

**Instructions**

Add all broth ingredients to a pot. Bring to a boil on medium heat, reduce heat to low and simmer for around 30 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the wonton filling until well incorporated. Place one heaping teaspoon of filling onto each wonton wrapper, wet the edges slightly with water, fold in half then bring all the edges together and pinch tightly to seal (please check notes for freezing instructions).

Baby bok choy: Wash thoroughly, then remove a small amount of the base whilst keeping the shape intact. Cut in half vertically, then in half again to obtain 4 sections. Blanch in some boiling water for 1-2 minutes until soft, rinse under cold water and drain.

Enoki mushrooms: Rinse only when you’re ready to use, otherwise they turn slimy. Cut off the brown, fibrous base and blanch for 1 minute. Rinse under cold water to stop the cooking and separate into 2 portions.

Noodles: Cook according to package instructions (in a pot of boiling water, not in the broth, as it would absorb too much liquid), rise under cold water then place in a serving bowl.

Remove all solid ingredients from the broth, then discard all but the shiitake mushrooms. Slice them thinly. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.

Cook wontons for 4-5 minutes, or according to package instructions if using store bought. They can be cooked in water or in the broth.

Add the prepared toppings over the cooked noodles (topping quantities per person - 1 shiitake mushroom, around 25g of enoki mushrooms, 5 wontons, ½ head of bok choy, ½ cup of corn) and divide the broth equally between the two portions. Drizzle some sesame oil and top with some green onions and/or other garnishes of choice.

**Notes**

* The number of portions can be easily adjusted by scaling the toppings in the proportions provided. The broth recipe provided serves 2, don’t forget to scale accordingly as well!
* For the broth, I just used some water and a veggie stock cube as that’s what I had on hand, as well as some frozen, store-bought wontons. Worked like a charm!
* This recipe makes 20 wontons, if not using all of them for this recipe they can also be frozen. Place them on a tray in a single layer and pop into the freezer - once frozen, around 2-3h later, they can be placed into a bag and will keep for around 3 months. To cook, simply place them still frozen in boiling water and cook for around 7-8 minutes.

* 250g of All-purpose flour + 2 more tablespoons for the filling
* 160g of hot water
* A bunch of scallions/green onion (depending of how much you want)
* 2 tablespoons of oil or lard
* Half a teaspoon of Five spices mix
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt (flaky salt would even be better)

&#x200B;

DIRECTIONS

1. Mix the 250g of flour and the hot water. If you are using a dough mixer, use the bread hook. If you go by hand, use some chopsticks at first to mix until you do not have any dry flour left, from that point knead it until combined.
2. Let the dough rest for 15 to 30 minutes, covered with a damp towel or some cling film.
3. During this time, chop the scallions thinly.
4. Also mix the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour with the oil/lard, salt and the Five spices mix to make the spice paste.
5. After resting the dough, slightly oil it and oil your rolling pin, and roll out the dough into a rectangle of a thickness of 1 to 2 mm.
6. Spread the spice paste evenly, leaving approximately 1cm at the top without the paste (so it can stick better) and top it with the sliced scallions.
7. Gently roll the dough into a cylinder shake (like a Swiss roll).
8. Cut into 4 cylinders, turn each peace on the flat end and press it down into a thin pancake (you can do it by hand or with the rolling pin)
9. Preheat some oil in a pan on medium heat and cook the pancakes with the lid on until golden-brown before flipping them.

2.	Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until browned all over and rare in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave to cool.  
  
3.	Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.  
  
4.	Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. Chill in the refrigerator.  
  
5.	Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.  
  
6.	Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.  
  
7.	Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.  
  
8.	Meanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on all sides. Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay and thyme and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.  
  
9.	Pour in the vinegar and let it bubble for a few minutes until almost dry. Now add the wine and boil until almost completely reduced. Add the stock and bring to the boil again. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, removing any scum from the surface of the sauce, until you have the desired consistency. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with muslin. Check for seasoning and set aside.  
  
10.	When you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash again, then bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. Rest for 10 minutes before carving.  
  
11.	Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Serve the beef wellingtons sliced, with the sauce as an accompaniment.  


Enjoy :)"

**Enjoy the recipe and United Cuisines on Youtube!**

INGREDIENTS \[20 Lamingtons in 9x9 in / 22 x 22 cm baking pan\]

For the batter:

\- 4 eggs

\- fine caster sugar \[150 g\]

\- all purpose flour \[1.5 cups / 180 g\]

\- baking powder \[1 tsp\]

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

For the coating:

\- powdered/icing sugar \[2.5 cups / 250 g\]

\- cocao powder \[5 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

\- milk \[1/2 cup / 120 ml\]

\- desiccated coconut flakes \[3 cups / 200 g\]

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Start by greasing your baking pan, properly line it with parchment paper and set aside. Pre-heat oven to 350°F / 180°C
2. To make the batter for the sponge cake, grab an electric mixer and a big bowl, crush the eggs and add the fine sugar. Begin whisking and beat the mass for a few minutes, till it drastically increases in size by almost 200%. Once the color desaturates and the batter turns less runny and starts to stick to your whisk, you can stop
3. Begin to gently incorporate the all purpose flour and baking powder, which you put into a mesh strainer and sift 1/4th of it over the batter. Gently fold it into the batter with a wooden spoon or spatula. Repeat the step 3 times with the remaining flour
4. Melt 2 tbsp of butter and fold it into the batter, as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extact, if you like
5. Transfer the batter into your lined baking pan and spread it all over, before giving it 1, 2, max 3 good tappy taps, in order to bring big bubbles to the surface. Don't overdo it, though! Remember, we created those many small bubbles on purpose, in order to get a spongy cake
6. Place in the middle of your pre-heated oven and bake for 15-25 minutes, depending on the oven and what sort of pan, glass or metal, you use
7. In parallel, take a medium-size bowl and combine the sifted icing sugar and sifted cocao powder
8. Pour the milk into your saucepan, add the butter and heat up together, till butter is melted and milk hot. Add it to the bowl and mix well, till sugar and cacao are dissolved. Let rest till completely cooled down
9. Get the cake out of the oven once done and place it on a cooling reck. Remove the parchment paper, and let cool down completely
10. Depending on your baking pan, the cake might end up with uneven edges, which you shall level, before cutting the whole cake in into beautiful squares of around 2 inch / 5 cm. You should end up with 20 pieces
11. Get two bowls ready, distribute 1/3 of the cacao-sauce in one and 1/3 desiccated coconuts in the other. Coat the sponge cakes well in the cacao sauce first, preferably use forks, elevate and let drain for a few seconds over the sauce-bowl, before dropping them into the coconuts. Use a spoon or your hands to fully cover the cakes in white coconuts flakes and transfer them on a rack to rest
12. Enjoy!

If you need me to clarify anything, I'd be happy to! I don't really measure everything such as the pepper and salt because it's something I feel depends on the person eating it!

My General Tso Recipe (Should feed 2 people with some rice or 1 very hungry person):

- 3/4 cup of water
- Tsp bouillon
- 1tbsp light soy sauce
- Tsp sesame oil
- Tsp dark soy sauce
- 1tbsp Sichuan chili oil
- little less than 1tsp msg (You can use something like oyster sauce if you don't have msg.)


**Marinade**

12-16oz chicken thighs

- Some Salt (The bouillon is fairly salty so don't overdo it)

Finish with sesame seeds and tsp sesame oil

**Directions**

- Cut chicken and let sit in marinade

- Mix sauce in separate cup

- Add cornstarch/flour to marinade until each piece is separate and fully covered/dry, eyeballing the ratios is fine! 

- Pour as much oil as necessary in wok (1-2 cups)

- Heat up oil to high

- When ready, place chicken in pan and fry for 5-7 minutes depending on size/color

- Take chicken out and let dry on paper towel, pour oil out of work

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/cu146m,https://i.redd.it/2e1e53gqe1i31.jpg,reddit,"**Ingredients**

* 10 large pickle sized cucumbers

* Whole jalapeno peppers

* 1 whole bulb of garlic

* A bunch of fresh dill

* Black peppercorns

* 2 Tablespoons of kosher salt

* 2 cups of white vinegar

* 4 cups of water

Start by combining water, vinegar, and salt in a pot. Bring to a boil until the salt is completely dissolved and remove from heat. Let them cool to room temperature.

Next, chop your cucumbers into spears, or chips (I chose chips, it's really just a matter of preference). Smash and chop cloves of garlic, however many depends on your desired taste. Halve or quarter your jalapenos, once again, however many depends on how hot you want your pickles to be. Add your chopped cucumbers, dill, black peppercorns, garlic and jalapenos to jars - be sure to not over pack the jars and save room for your brine.

Once the jars are ready with ingredients added to your desired taste, pour the cooled brine in until filled and lid your jars. Put them into the fridge and let them sit for 5-7 days. These will keep for about 6-8 weeks after that with a nice crunchy texture!

I'm a snacker, so when I get the urge these things are a perfect go to. They are also nice to give to friends who like pickles."

# Ingredients

* 1 cup sugar
* 4 tablespoon butter
* 100 grams heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

# Instructions

1. Heat (medium heat) sugar once it starts melting. Pay attention to move the pan once in a time.
2. Sugar should be heated until it is caramelized.
3. Then add butter and stir it until it melts.
4. Add cream and stir it well. In the first place it becomes thick, but stir it during the heating until it becomes smooth.
5. After removing it from heating, add vanilla and salt, then stir.

## Tips and tricks

* Adding salt is optional, but personally, for having the incredible flavor of the caramel and preventing the extensive flavor of sweetness, it is great to use salt.
* pay attention that the sugar not get burned. If it burns, the only flavor you taste is a burning caramel."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/f30w4c,https://i.redd.it/ilhpn7s52lg41.jpg,reddit,"### INGREDIENTS

**For the Salted Caramel:**

* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons salted butter, room temperature, cubed
* ¼ cup heavy cream
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt

**For the Brownies:**

* 6 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate
* 1 cup salted butter
* 4 large eggs
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* ¾ cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup caramel chips or salted caramel chips
* flaky sea salt

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Make the Salted Caramel**: Line an 8×8 inch baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside. In medium saucepan, heat sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly. Don’t worry when you see the sugar becoming clumpy. It will begin to melt into an amber colored liquid as you continue to heat and stir it. Keep an eye on it, as you don’t want it to burn. Once sugar is completely melted, add in butter (be careful, it may splatter!) and whisk until fully incorporated. Slowly drizzle in the heavy cream while stirring the mixture. Boil for one minute then remove from the heat and stir in the salt. Pour into prepared pan and place in freezer to firm up, about 20-30 minutes. Make the brownies while the caramel is setting up
2. **Make the Brownies**: Preheat oven to 350°F and line a second 8×8 baking pan (see note) with parchment paper. Set aside. Melt the chocolate and butter in a saucepan over medium low heat until pieces are melted. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the eggs on medium speed until light yellow (\~ 5 minutes). Add sugar and blend on low until combined. Add vanilla and melted chocolate to the egg sugar mixture then add flour and beat until smooth. Stir in caramel chips. Pour batter into prepared pan. Remove caramel from the freezer and lift parchment out of the pan. Place on a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut caramel into squares. Place caramel squares on top of brownie batter, spreading evenly over surface. (You will not use all of them) 
3. **Bake Brownies**: Bake for about 45-55 minutes (toothpick inserted into center should come out clean when done – do not overbake). Cool to room temperature then cover and refrigerate for at least one hour. Spread top with the remaining salted caramel (warmed so it’ll spread evenly), sprinkle with flaky sea salt, and cut into 16 squares"

#### Copied here:

#### INGREDIENTS:

* ***Beef stock***:
* Beef bones
* 1 tablespoon of olive oil
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 white onion cut in half
* 1 carrots cut in half
* 1 leek cut in half
* 1 ginger cut in half
* 3 bay leaves
* Parsley/coriander
* Salt & Pepper
* 5 cups of water
* ***MEAT***:
* 1 steak of your choice (I used 1 piece of 200 gr Sirloin)
* Soy sauce
* Worcestershire sauce
* Salt & pepper
* ***Noodles***:
* rice or wheat noodles
* Salt & pepper
* Sesame oil
* ***Topping****:*
* 2 eggs
* 2 small leeks
* Parsley
* Soy sauce
* Mirin
* Finely chopped ginger (about 2 teaspoons)

#### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. ***Stock:***  
Wash the bones to get rid of impurities and blood. Boil them in salty hot water for 10 minutes to make sure they are cleaned. Drain them and set aside.  
In a pot, put the rest of the ingredients to saute for 2 minutes in olive oil, add the bones and saute for an extra 2 minutes then add the water after boiling it and let it shimmer over low heat for as long as you can. (6 hours should be enough, If you want a richer, more concentrated flavor, cook longer to reduce more.) Strain and leave the liquid to cool down, this will help you skim the fat that will float on top of the stock.
2. ***Meat***:  
While the stock is cooking, marinate the meat in 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, a pinch of salt and pepper for at least 1 hour (or while the stock is cooking). When the stock is ready, Cook the meat in a high heated skillet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 2 minutes per side, and cut into thin slices.
3. ***Noodles***:  
Boil noodles with some salt, and add to them one tablespoon of sesame oil after draining them.
4. ***Topping:***  
Boil the eggs for 7 minutes. Set aside.  
In a bowl, mix 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon Mirin, ginger, finely chopped leek and parsley. Then add the eggs after cutting them in half and add to the mixture. Let marinate for at least 1 hour (Or while the stock is cooking).
5. ***Assembling:***  
Pour 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a serving bowl. Then pour the stock (about the 3/4 of the bowl), add the noodles, the meat slices on one of the sides, 2 egg halves on the other side and 2 tablespoons of the rest of the eggs marinade on top. Sprinkle some chopped parsley and leeks on top or any other topping you like. ENJOOOOY!"

* 2 cups chocolate (any kind you like – I like to mix semi-sweet and milk chocolate in a 50/50 mixture)  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Place chocolate in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, then stir. Continue microwaving in 15-second increments, then stirring, until the chocolate is melted and smooth.
2. In a separate bowl, warm up peanut butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. Then stir in the powdered sugar until smooth. It shouldn’t be very sticky anymore and you should be able to press it between your fingers and it holds together.
3. Using a teaspoon (the one from the silverware drawer), scoop up a bit of the melted chocolate and drip it into the cupcake liners. Using the tip of the spoon, gently nudge it to the edge of the liner, so the entire bottom is covered in a thin layer of chocolate.
4. Next, scoop up a small bit of the peanut butter mixture and roll it into a 1″ ball. Press the ball flat between the palms of your hands to form a disc.
5. Place this disc of peanut butter on top of the chocolate layer in the cupcake pan.
6. Finally, using a teaspoon again, scoop up some more of the melted chocolate and drizzle it over top of the peanut butter in a thin layer. Again, using the tip of the spoon, gently nudge it around so that it drips down all sides of the peanut butter.
7. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to chill.
8. Then just remove the cupcake liners and enjoy!"

# Crawfish Étouffée

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb Crawfish Tails
* 8 tbsp Flour
* 8 tbsp Butter
* 1 cup diced Celery
* 1 cup diced Bell Pepper
* 1 cup diced Onion
* 2 tbsp minced Garlic
* 1 tbsp fresh Thyme
* 1 tbsp fresh Parsley
* 1 tsp Cajun Spice Blend
* 1/2 tsp fresh Black Pepper
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 3 cups Chicken Broth with crawfish/veg scraps
* 2-4 cups prepared Jasmine Rice

The Cajun Spice Blend

* 3 Tbsp Paprika
* 2 Tbsp Garlic
* 1 Tbsp Sea Salt
* 1 Tbsp Onion
* 1 Tbsp Black Pepper
* ½ Tbsp White Pepper
* ½ Tbsp Oregano
* 1 tsp Cayenne
* ½ Tbsp Thyme

**Instructions**

1. Grind the spices for the spice blend or use store bought. If using store bought don't remove the fresh thyme and parsley.
2. Start a pot for broth. Simmer chicken broth and the crawfish heads/peels, onion scraps and a little of the celery scraps. Set aside at least 3 cups.
3. Cook rice per package instructions. I use a rice cooker at 1 part rice to 1.5 parts water.
4. In a heavy pan like a Dutch oven heat butter until bubbles stop and stir in flour. Stir for 5-10 minutes until color is blond. Light peanut butter is okay but  dark roux is not used for Étouffée. See tips.
5. Add the trinity onion, celery, and bell peppers and cook until celery is tender.
6. Add aromatics: fresh herbs, spices and garlic
7. Add 2-3 cups of broth and simmer for 30 minutes.
8. Add crawfish tails and heat through. They're already cooked.
9. Plate with rice and garnish with parsley and green onion. Serve with warm crusty bread.

Tip: The best tails are those saved from a crawfish boil. If using store bought get the pre-peeled tails not the frozen whole crawfish.

Tip: Sub the crawfish for shrimp. Never tried but I bet seared chicken chunks would be fine. Lump crab is always welcome.

Tip: For a more Creole style add some diced tomato to the simmer step and a Creole spice blend rather than the Cajun.

Tip: Roux requires constant attention. Never walk away from a roux. If you see small black specks consider starting over as the roux will be bitter.

Tip: Sub the roux butter for a nice vegetable oil in the same amount."

After many attempts, from a tiny cookbook my grandma gave me, to BBC Good Food, and even this subreddit, I have found the perfect one (so you guys don’t have to).

[link to recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-fudgy-homemade-brownies)

**Ingredients**

- 1/2 cup (115g) salted or unsalted butter

- two 4-ounce (226g) semi-sweet chocolate bars, coarsely chopped

- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar

- 1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark brown sugar

- 3 eggs 

- 1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons (79g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)

- 2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

**Important to note**

I didn’t add vanilla extract OR chocolate chips because i didn’t have any, but the recipe says you can! I also used the grams measurement.

**Directions**

1. Measure your butter and chocolate out in a big bowl, then stick it on top of a saucepan with water (also known as a bain-marie) to melt it. Then, let the mixture cool, otherwise you’ll cook the egg.

2. Once mixture is cool, whisk in (I used a stand-mixer, but a good old handheld metal one will be fine, you’ll just end up super hench) the sugar and eggs. 

3. Make sure to use a sieve to sift in your salt, cocoa powder and flour. Then use a spatula to fold in the dry ingredients, don’t whisk!

4. Add your mixture to a lined tray (I line mine with baking powder, I don’t like just greasing it) and evenly spread out the mixture you have managed not to eat.

5. Bake in the oven at 180 degrees celsius (pls google the F equivalent) for about 25 minutes, after 20 I usually stick a butter knife in. You want your knife to come out with bits of crumbs and goo, but not too much. You **DONT** want the knife to be clean.

6. Leave to cool (I don’t have a cooling rack to I put about an inch and a half of cold water into my sink and put the tray in there so it was half submerged). 

They’re nice to eat warm, cold etc. Just don’t store them in the fridge, otherwise they’ll go hard and weird.

Enjoy :)"

**Carne Asada**

* 1 lb flat iron steak  

   * Or a steak of your choice: Skirt steak, hanger steak, flat iron, flat iron, etc.
* 30 ml Olive Oil
* Juice of 1 Lime
* 6 g Salt
* 2 g Cumin
* 2 g Smoked Paprika
* 2 g Ancho Chile Powder
* Shot of mezcal or tequila (optional)

**Method:**

1. Using a sharp knife, slice the steak across the grain into very thin strips. Add the steak to a large bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, add the olive oil, lime juice, lime zest, salt, cumin, smoked paprika, and chile powder and whisk together. Pour the marinade over the steak and mix with your hands. Cover and let sit in the fridge for 30  minutes or up to 6 hours.   


* **Note:** While the steak is marinating, you can make fresh tortillas! Also if pressed on time, feel free to skip the time in the fridge, it will still be delicious.

1. Set a cast-iron over high heat. When ready to cook, add the shot of mezcal and mix it into the steak. The alcohol will help carry aromas and flavors from the marinade. When the cast iron is ripping hot, let the excess marinade drip off the steak and evenly spread out on the cast iron. Grill until the steak is well charred, remove and set on a platter.
2. Melt cheese with the steak and add to a fresh tortillas to make a quesadilla or serve with rice, salsa, or anything else your heart desires.

**Chipotle Cilantro Chimichurri**

* 1 dried chipotle mecco (substitute 1 chipotle in adobo)
* Large handful cilantro (stems included)
* 1 clove garlic, peeled
* 30 ml Olive oil
* Juice from 1 lime
* Zest from 1/2 lime
* Salt to taste
* Fresh ground pepper

**Method:**

2. In a food processor, add the chipotle, cilantro, garlic clove, olive oil, lime juice, zest of lime, and a few cranks of black pepper. Pulse until well combined.
3. Taste it. Add salt as needed. Spoon over carne asada.

**Flour Tortillas (adapted from Diana Kennedy)**

* 450 g bread flour
* 80 g lard (or butter / vegetable oil)\*
* 5 g coarse kosher salt
* 250 ml warm water

**Method**

1. Add the flour to a bowl and rub in the lard (or butter) using your finger tips until broken up.
2. Dissolve the salt in the warm water. Gradually add the water and mix it into the flour mixture to see how much it will absorb.
3. Turn the dough onto a flat surface and work into a cohesive dough with your hands for about 5 minutes. At the end, the dough should be fairly smooth and not sticking to your hands. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours.
4. Divide the dough into 9 pieces (for a medium burrito size) by weighing them out on a scale (about 80 g). Roll them into very smooth small balls with your hands.   


* **Note**: The dough balls can be stored in your fridge for 3-4 days for on demand fresh tortillas.

1. Heat a large griddle or cast iron pan over medium heat.
2. Flatten the tortilla ball and roll out to your desired thinness.
3. Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle and cook for 10-20 seconds, then flip to the other side to cook for another 10-20 seconds. The tortillas should be lightly browned in spots. Be careful not to overcook the tortilla or else they will become hard instead of soft and pliable.
4. Immediately, stack the tortillas in a large cloth or clean kitchen towel until you are ready for serving.

**Note**: Diana’s original recipe calls for 115 g. I made it with that amount the first time around before lowering the amount of fat. The tortillas are just as good texture and flavor wise while saving calories so that’s why I lowered it."

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/g4irmn,https://i.imgur.com/6FOumOU.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients:

1½ cups (200 g) all-purpose flour (spooning into measuring cups, then leveling)

1¼ tsp. (4 g) Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. (4 g) Morton kosher salt

¾ tsp. (4 g) baking soda

¾ cup (1½ sticks; 169 g) unsalted butter, divided

1 cup (200 g) (packed) dark brown sugar

¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar

1 large egg

2 large egg yolks

2 tsp. vanilla extract

6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%–70% cacao), coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:

 Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.

Cook ½ cup (1 stick; 113 g) butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about 4 minutes. Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute. Cut remaining ¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).

Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add egg and egg yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk in vanilla. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in chocolate (the dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).

Using a 1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/lai5v7,https://i.redd.it/i9k1c5esfye61.jpg,reddit,"**Ingredients - the Dough:**

* 228g grams all-purpose flour
* 1.5 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 Tbs Kosher salt and 1.5 tsp  black pepper
* 130 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* 4 oz grated Gruyère 						
* ice water 					

**Ingredients - Filling:**

* Olive oil
* butter
* 1 large or two small onions
* 4 fresh thyme sprigs
* Salt and pepper
* Sliced crimini mushrooms, 2-3 cups (or any combination of mushrooms you like)
* 1/4 cup dry sherry (vermouth or dry white wine in a pinch)
* 1 cup beef broth
* Broccolini

**NOTES:** A good home-made beef stock makes a giant difference here; store-bought beef stock is barely-OK stuff; if you're stuck with it, reduce 2-3 cups of boxed stock down to 1 cup. We make this for meatless dinners, but you could think of it as ""modern meatloaf"" - what's in the fridge that you want to use? This takes some time, but it's a nice Sunday afternoon project.

**Directions:**

Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt and  black pepper. Add chopped butter and grated Gruyère to the flour mixture and toss to coat. Pinch the butter and cheese into the flour to make pebble-size pieces and smeared-flat butter blobs. Drizzle in ice water a little at a time, and stir to make a shaggy dough. Gently knead the dough on a floured surface 3-4 times, form into a fat disc, and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for an hour or more. 

Preheat oven to 375°

Put the wrapped dough ball on the counter to begin warming a bit.

Slice the onions into 1/4"" thin slices. Heat a skillet to medium with a tbs or so olive oil; when the oil is warm, add 1 tbs butter. Add the onions and thyme sprigs, toss to coat, and cover the pan for 5 minutes until the onions soften. remove the lid and cook the onions until edges are golden brown and onions are very soft, 15-20 minutes, tossing occasionally. Don't burn 'em. 

While the onions are cooking, cut the broccolini. You want 1-2 cups. Slice the bottoms of the stems so the remaining spears are 4-5"" long, and slice each spear from top to bottom - you want the stems to be 1/8"" - 1/4"" thick. Slice the florets into somewhat flat pieces, and slice the stems into 1"" long segments. 

Remove the onions to a mixing bowl. Add another Tbs of olive oil and heat the skillet to medium high. When the oil is hot, add 2 tbs butter; when the butter melts, quickly add the mushrooms, some salt and pepper to taste, and cover the pan (this releases liquid from the mushrooms without drying them out instantly). After 2-3 minutes, remove the lid and toss the mushrooms, and cover for another minute or so. Remove the lid and continue cooking the mushrooms until well browned.

Return the onions to the pan and add the sherry; deglaze the pan with a spatula and add the stock. Turn up the heat and reduce until the liquid thickens; reduce the heat to medium-low and continue stirring until the liquid thickens a bit more, to a sauce, Add the broccoli and toss until coated. Discard the thyme sprigs.

Transfer the onion mixture to a bowl and put it in the fridge or freezer - you want to cool it until it's just barely warm.

Lay out a sheet of parchment paper, about 18"" long. Lightly flour the paper, unwrap the dough, and place it dead-center on the paper. With your fingers, gently work the dough into a disc, about 8"" wide. Sprinkle flour on the top, and use a rolling pin to make a 15-16"" circle. Parchment paper is 15"" wide, so just go past the 15"" edges. The edges don't need to be perfectly round.

Spoon the cooled onion mixture on the center of the dough, and spread it so it covers about 10-11"" of the center; you want about 4 to 5 inches of dough left all around. Fold the dough up over the filling so about 6"" of filling is exposed. Gently tap the high folded spots down a bit. Lift the parchment paper to place the gallette on a large baking sheet and into the oven.

This needs to bake about 40-50 minutes; but check it after 15 minutes - if butter is pooling around the sides, mop it up with a paper towel and tongs so keep butter from running down into the oven and burning. At 25 minutes, rotate the baking sheet 180° and mop up any more butter.

When the crust is golden brown, sprinkle 1 oz of grated Gruyere across the top and return to the oven for 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Using the parchment paper, move the gallette from the sheet to a cutting board and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing like a pizza. You can garnish with fresh thyme leaves if you like."

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/161436/omas-rhubarb-cake/

- 1 1/4 cups white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup sour cream
- 3 cups diced rhubarb (use 4 cups if you like rhubarb)
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1/4 cup butter, softened
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- ground cinnamon, for dusting

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking dish.

In a large bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cups sugar, baking soda, salt and 2 cups flour. Stir in the eggs and sour cream until smooth, then fold in the rhubarb. Pour into the prepared dish and spread evenly. In a smaller bowl, stir together the remaining 1 cup sugar and butter until smooth. Stir in 1/4 cup flour until the mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle the mixture on top of the cake then dust lightly with cinnamon.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Side note:
The recipe said 3 cups rhubarb, but I think you should use 4. Mine was delicious, but it could use more rhubarb."

**Ingredients:**

- 4 lamb shanks, around 400g each, cleaned and with the bone frenched

- 1 tsp garlic powder

- 1 tsp ground cinnamon

- 1 tsp ground cumin

- 1 tsp smoked paprika

- 1 tsp chilli flakes

- 1 tsp salt

- 1 tsp ground pepper

- 1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped

- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 4 tbsp vegetable oil

- 250ml dry red wine

- 2 large onions, julienned

- 1 large carrot, roughly chopped

- 6 garlic cloves, smashed

- 4 bay leaves

- 500ml chicken stock

**Preparation:**

1. Make the seasoning by combining garlic powder, cinnamon, cumin, paprika, chilli, salt, pepper and rosemary.

2. Rub some olive oil on the shanks, then coat thoroughly with the seasoning. Marinade in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours. The longer, the better (up to 36 hours I would say). 

3. Heat some vegetable oil in a large, oven-safe pot over high heat. As soon as the oil gets very hot (barely starting to smoke), start searing the shanks until browned on all sides. Work in batches if your pot is not big enough.

4. Add the wine, onion, carrot, garlic and bay leaves. Sit the meat on top of the veggies so it doesn’t directly touch the pot.

5. Add the stock, bring to a simmer, then transfer to an oven preheated to 160C. Braise for 3 hours or until the meat is really tender - literally falling of the bone.

6. Reserve the shanks, strain the liquid and cook to reduce to your desired thickness.

7. Serve with some sauce poured on top of the shanks, and some extra on the side.

**Ingredients:**

* ½ white onion
* 1 green bell pepper
* 2 cups of sliced shiitake mushrooms
* 1 bulb garlic
* 1 tbsp anchovy paste
* ¼ cup classico fire roasted pizza sauce

* 4 tbsp lucini extra virgin olive oil
* 6 oz fresh mozzarella

**Instructions:**

Used trader Joe’s garlic and herb pizza dough, letting rest on the counter for 2 hours until room temp. While that was resting I chopped half a white onion and a green bell pepper into super thin slices and began to sauté in olive oil with salt and pepper. Once softened, I added two cups of sliced shiitake mushrooms and continued to sauté. Next I minced and added an entire bulb of garlic, along with a tbsp of anchovy paste. Finally, I cubed up my Italian meats which consisted of 6 thin slices each of hot capocollo, soprassata, and genoa salame, which I cooked for a few more minutes then reserved. Finally I stretched my dough in the flavored oil until it filled the pan and then started browning the bottom on the stove top. I spooned over some premade pizza sauce, my sautéed toppings, and chunks of fresh mozzarella, and transferred into a 550F oven and watched for the cheese to bubble and brown (about 20 mins). I wanted extra melty cheese with tons of toppings which is why I sauteed them first and put them under the cheese. This made them smaller, concentrating the flavors, and the cheese held them on while eating. Delicious dinner which I ate in front of a fireplace."

* 1 tablespoon of olive oil
* 2 cloves of garlic (minced)
* 2 jalapeños (minced)
* 1 cup of rice (I usually use jasmine)
* 1 cup of vegetable broth
* 1 (15 oz) can of black beans (drained)
* 1 (15 oz) can of diced tomatoes (drained)
* 1 cup of corn kernels (I typically put 2-3 cups in mine)
* 1 teaspoon of chilli powder
* 1/2 teaspoon of cumin
* Salt and pepper (to taste)

**Directions:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place ground beef in the skillet and break into smaller pieces as it cooks. Add seasoning to taste (I typically use seasoning salt). Cook until all pieces are brown (about 10 minutes).
2. Add another tablespoon of olive oil and then add the garlic and jalapeno and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until it's fragrant (about 1-2 minutes).
3. Stir in the rice, vegetable broth, beans, tomatoes, corn, chili powder, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. Serve and enjoy!

**Notes:**

* Instead of adding lime juice, try enjoying this rice with ""Hint of lime"" Tostitos, if you can find them. It never disappoints!
* If you're like me and make this for lunches throughout the week, it does keep pretty well in the fridge for several days (as long as it's in an airtight container) but it's always best to eat it within 1-3 days I'd say.
* Try adding some shredded Tex-Mex cheese and Frank's Red Hot to it (I add it each time I take a small portion for lunch and then reheat it). It adds a lot of flavor and the cheese makes it easier to eat especially if you're using tortilla chips."

Ingredients:

Cookies:

•1 and 1/4 cups (2.5 sticks; 290g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature

•1 cup (200g) packed dark brown sugar

•1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar

•1 large egg, at room temperature

•2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

•1 Tablespoon dark molasses

•1 and 1/2 cups (187g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)

•1 teaspoon baking soda

•1/2 teaspoon salt

•3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

•1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

•3 cups (240g) quick oats (not whole oats)

Creme Filling:

•3/4 cup (1.5 sticks; 175g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature

•3 cups (360g) confectioners’ sugar

•3 Tablespoons (45ml) heavy cream

•1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

•salt, to taste

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (191°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Set aside.
2. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars together on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in the egg, vanilla, and molasses, scraping down the sides as needed. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and oats.
4. With the mixer running on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to wet ingredients. The dough will be quite thick and you may have to mix it all by hand after a few seconds in the mixer. 
5. Drop dough with a large cookie scoop, or make sure each ball of dough is 2 Tablespoons. Cookies will spread in the oven, so drop each ball of dough 3 inches apart.
6. Bake for 10 minutes or until cookies are lightly golden around the edges. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

For the filling: 
1. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat butter on high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. 
2. Add the confectioners’ sugar and beat on medium speed for 1-2 minutes. 
3. Pour in heavy cream and vanilla extract. Beat on high for 2-3 minutes until fluffy. Taste and add a pinch or two of salt, as needed. If filling is way too thick, add a couple more teaspoons of heavy cream. 
4. Spread 1.5 Tablespoons of cream filling on the bottom side of half of the cookies; top with remaining cookies, right side up.

Cookies stay fresh and soft (with creme filling) at room temperature for 2 days in an airtight container. After that, store in the refrigerator to keep the creamy filling fresh."

It is a delicious addition to many Asian dishes, perfect for a hot sunny day. Great booster for your gut microbiome as well :)

I recommend you try Vaccum packing for your fermented products as it can save you space and create an anaerobic environment that prevents the development of unwanted pathogens. Here you can find the device and the bags at a good price.

**Ingredients:**

\* 700g of cucumbers (pickling variety)

\* 14g of salt (2% per cucumber weight)

\* 1 medium-sized carrot cut into 5cm julienne

\* a handful of chives

\* 3tbsp of Gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes)

\* 1,5tbsp of minced garlic

\* 2tsp of minced ginger

\* half of the red apple, grated

\* 1,5tbsp of sugar

\* 1tsp of minced Saeujeot (Korean salted shrimp)(use more fish sauce if not available)

\* 1tsp of fish sauce (Use dark soy sauce for vegetarian version)

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare cucumbers by removing their ends, then cut them in half lengthways. Now divide into 5cm parts and cut each part 3 times at an angle. Place in the large bowl with julienned carrots and chives then mix in the salt. Rest for 25 minutes.
2. In the meantime prepare Gochugaru paste by mixing all the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl.
3. Once cucumbers are ready combine them with paste.
4. Transfer everything into a jar or a vacuum bag and seal. Leave at room temperature for 2 days then move into the fridge. 
5.  Once chilled, Cucumber Kimchi is ready for consumption. It will develop more flavour over the next few days but it will lose the crunch and the cucumber will become mushier, so I don't recommend it for long time storage like traditional Kimchi.

4. Remove the dough and make 4 indentations evenly spaced in the dough with the back of a spoon, but not too close to the edge of the dough. This is where you’ll place the eggs.
5. Very gently crack one egg into each indentation, being careful not to break the yolk.
6. Crumble bacon and place around the eggs on the crust of the pizza.
7. Carefully place the pizza back in the oven and cook for 8 minutes for runny yolks.
8. The pizza is done and the yolks are runny once the whites are set but the yolks are still jiggly.
9. Remove from the oven and season eggs with kosher salt and black pepper. Finely chop parsley and garnish.
10. Cut into 4 pieces, avoiding the egg yolk and enjoy.

### Notes

* If you’re having a hard time stretching the dough, walk away for 5 minutes and try again.
* If you’re worried about breaking the yolks, crack one egg into a small bowl and gently place in the indentation instead of cracking the eggs directly onto the pizza.
* Cook the eggs for longer (1-2 minutes) for firmer yolks.
* Grate 6 garlic cloves as a substitute for garlic paste."

**Stuffing**

* Short Grain Sweet Rice (2 cups) / Water to 1.5cups in rice cooker
* Chinese Sausage (4 pieces)
* Sweet Onion (1/2 large)
* Celery (3 large stalks)
* Carrots (1 medium)
* Seasoned Stuffing (6 oz)
* Chicken Broth (1 box / 32 oz)
* Five Spice (1.5 tsp)
* Salt (2 tsp)
* Black Pepper (2 tsp)
* Dry Basil (as needed)

&#x200B;

1. Prep all the ingredients: Dice the sausages, onion, celery and carrots. Wash the sweet rice and cook in a rice cooker with 1.5 cup of water (in rice cooker).
2. Add some oil in a large pan and cook onions and sausage for about 5 minutes or until you see it begin to brown. Then throw in celery and carrots and cook just for a couple of minutes. Add in the salt/pepper/five spice/ oyster sauce and combine well. Transfer into a mixing bowl
3. Add the cooked rice into the mixing bowl as well, and chicken stock. Make sure you add your stock in increments. Mix everything thoroughly and then toss in the seasoned stuffing and basil. Combine it all.

You can eat this by itself by baking at 350° until the it reaches 160° about 40 minutes. You can also do this ahead of time, the night before and leave in fridge. (DO NOT BAKE IF USING AS ACTUAL STUFFING)

**Big Bird**

* Turkey (12-16 pounds) (pre-brined)
* Butter (6 oz)
* Sage, Thyme, Basil (1/2 tsp of each)
* Salt and Pepper (large pinch of both)
* Garlic Powder (1 tbl)
* Bao Bei Stuffing (as needed)

&#x200B;

1. Wash the turkey, spread the wings out and open up the legs. Take out any interior parts and discard. Remove fat from the skin of butt and neck area. Transfer to a board and dry it very well with some paper towels (inside and out). Separate turkey skin from the meat carefully using hands, being sure to not break the skin. (Just the top side you serve with)
2. Combine spices into room temp butter to make a thick sauce mix. (If too liquid leave in fridge for a little bit) Then rub the butter mixture into the turkey, both inside the skin and outside as well. Tuck the Turkey Wings underneath the body and transfer into a roasting pan.
3. Stuff the cavities of the turkey with our Bao Bei stuffing and then tie up the legs with twine. Place Turkey in a Roast pan. (Pour some extra chicken stock in the pan as well) Cover with foil.
4. Roast at 350° for 3 hours so the thick parts of the turkey get to 155°. Be sure to rotate the turkey at least once, and baste with turkey drippings at least 3 times. Finish the Turkey on a high broil for the perfect color. Take out and Let rest for 30min-1hr

Reserve the drippings inside the pan for Gravy (Be sure you separate the fat out)"

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/f91ikw,https://i.redd.it/tx2k9o0evyi41.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients 

200g high quality softened unsalted butter

1 cup caster sugar 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Zest from two large unwaxed lemons

4 eggs at room temperature 

1/2 cup milk

2/3 cup lemon juice (juice from two lemons)

2 cups sifted all purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

Method

Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius and grease a standard round cake tin. 

In an electric mixer on a medium speed, beat the butter, sugar, lemon zest and vanilla extract until pale and smooth. Slowly add the eggs one by one, scraping the side of the bowl with a silicone spatula in between until the batter is smooth. Add the milk to the batter and mix through and then the lemon juice. 

Sift the baking powder and flour into a separate bowl. On a low speed, add one third of the flour and baking powder into the batter and mix through. Repeat this step two more times ensuring you do not overbeat the batter. 

Place your batter into the cake tin. Smooth out the top of the cake with a spatula and bang the tin onto your kitchen bench several times to remove any air bubbles and to smooth out your batter. This will ensure your cake bakes evenly. Bake for 55 minutes. 

Leave your cake to cool in the cake tin for 10 minutes and then carefully remove and leave to cool on a cooling rack. Dust your cake with icing sugar and enjoy with cream or ice cream.

**INGREDIENTS:**

* 2 cups chopped strawberries, some set aside for extra topping
* 1 tbsp of sugar
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 cups short bread or vanilla cookies, crushed up
* popsicle molds (super cheap on Amazon!)

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Chop strawberries up small and pulse in a food processor with 1 tbsp of sugar, be sure to leave some bigger pieces of strawberries in the mix and don’t process it all the way to a liquid
2. Add heavy cream to a bowl and whip using a whisk or electric mixer until still peaks form, then add the sweetened condensed milk & vanilla extract and whip to combine, this is your ice cream base
3. Fold the strawberry puree into the ice cream base until almost combined, the mix should look marbled 
4. Fill your popsicle molds with your strawberry cream ice-cream, place popsicle sticks into each mold most of the way down, but not completely touching the bottom of the mold. Freeze until firm (approx. 4 hours - overnight)
5. When your ice-cream bars are ready to add toppings, crush up a handful of cookies either by pulsing lightly in a food processor or with your hands, leaving larger crumbs. Take some of the extra strawberries you saved and chop into very tiny pieces.  

6. Run popsicle molds under lukewarm water to loosen and then remove from molds. Place on parchment paper and allow to sit so they soften slightly, just enough for your cookie crumble to stick.
7. Lay each popsicle into your cookie crumbs until coated, pressing the crumbs into the ice-cream bars, press small strawberry pieces into bars on top of cookie crumble. Place completed ice-cream bars back into the fridge to firm back up a little bit (or else they will melt very quickly!) and then enjoy!

So crunchy yet juicy, and the kimchi mayo helps bringing this dish to another level of deliciousness! 

**INGREDIENTS:**

**A. For chicken & marinate:**

* 500g of boneless, skin on chicken meat (thigh/breast)
* 3 smashed cloves of garlic
* 1 egg white
* 1tbs Korean soy sauce
* 1.5 tbs sesame oil
* ½ tsp white pepper powder
* 1 tbs corn starch
* A sprinkle of salt

&#x200B;

**B. For Kimchi Mayo: (start with less, taste, then add more if needed)**

* 2 tbs finely chopped kimchi
* 2 tbs kimchi juice
* 1 tbs sugar
* 1tbs Korean hot pepper flakes
* A squeeze of lime juice
* 4 tbs mayo

&#x200B;

**C. For sprinkles:**

* 1 large sheet of nori seaweed
* 1 tbs untoasted white sesame seeds

&#x200B;

**D. For Frying:**

* 7-8 tbs tapioca starch or more if needed
* Canola oil

&#x200B;

**TIPS:**

\- I used chicken thighs with skin on, but you can use chicken tenders or breasts as well.

\- All mayo and kimchi have different level of salt, sugar and acidity. My kimchi was very sour, so I had to add a little more sugar. Because of the differences, make sure to use lesser, so that you can taste and adjust to your own taste bud!

\- Caramelising kimchi helps to tone down the funky smell and takes the raw taste off. Plus, who doesn’t love anything caramelised?

&#x200B;

**STEPS:**

**A.**  **Marinating chicken:**

* Cut chicken into bite-sized cubes, then add other ingredients
* Mix well and refrigerate for 1 hour

**B.** **Making Kimchi Mayo:**

* In a small pan, add 1tbs of oil.
* Add finely chopped kimchi and fry until caramelized
* Add sugar and kimchi juice. Reduce and allow the mixture to cool down before mixing other ingredients in.
* In a bowl, combine all ingredients, then taste and add more sugar/salt/lime if needed. The tanginess and umami of kimchi should come first, with just a little bit of sweetness to balance things up.

**C.** **Making sprinkles:**

* Use tongs to toast nori seaweed under the lowest flame until crispy
* Toast sesame seeds in a small pan until lightly golden
* Blend both into fine powder and set aside

**D.** **Frying:**

* On a large tray, add 7 tbs of tapioca starch, add more later if needed.
* Drop chicken cubes and coat well. Make sure they don’t clump together.
* Rest for 10 mins
* Heat oil in a wok under medium heat, use chopstick to test the oil. Bubbles = ready.
* Drop chicken pieces into oil. Shake off excess starch if necessary
* Remove once the cubes are lightly golden
* Skim the small bits if needed, then bring to medium high heat for 1-2 mins
* Double fry the chicken for extra crisp
* Remove once golden brown
* Immediately toss the sprinkles together with the chicken in a large bow
* Serve immediately. Enjoy with kimchi mayo and adults, I strongly advice to grab a bottle of ice-cold beer! Cheeeeers!

**For the Cake**:

* ½ cup unsalted butter (1 stick)
* 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cup mashed banana (from 2 to 3 very ripe bananas)
* ¼ cup sour cream
* 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**For the Salted Caramel:**

* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons salted butter, room temperature, cubed
* ¼ cup heavy cream
* ½ teaspoon salt

**For the Salted Caramel Buttercream:**

* 2 cups confectioner’s sugar
* ½ cup salted butter
* 2 tablespoons heavy cream
* ¼ cup Salted Caramel (from above)

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8×8 inch baking pan with parchment paper letting the two long ends hang over the edges by at least 2 inches. Butter the top of the parchment and set aside 
2. **Brown the butter**: Melt the butter in a small saucepan, cooking and stirring until the butter is just browned (be careful not to cook too long or it’ll burn)
3. **Make the Cake Batter**: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, granulated sugar, baking soda and salt. Whisk in bananas, browned butter, sour cream, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla. Scrape into baking pan and smooth the top with a small offset spatula or butter knife. Bake until the top springs back when lightly pressed in the center, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely before frosting
4. **Prepare Salted Caramel**: In medium saucepan, heat sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly. Don’t worry when you see the sugar becoming clumpy. It will begin to melt into an amber colored liquid as you continue to heat and stir it. Keep an eye on it, as you don’t want it to burn. Once sugar is completely melted, add in butter (be careful, it may splatter!) and whisk until fully incorporated. Slowly drizzle in the heavy cream while stirring the mixture. Boil for one minute then remove from the heat and stir in the salt. Allow to cool while you make the buttercream
5. **Make the Buttercream**:  In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment affixed, combine the confectioner’s sugar, butter and heavy cream, mixing until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Turn the mixer off, add in the cooled salted caramel sauce (reserve a small amount to drizzle on top later) and stir to combine evenly
6. **Frost the Banana Cake**: Spread the buttercream evenly over the cooled cake, then drizzle the reserved salted caramel over top. Cut into small squares and dive in!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fbsr1t,https://i.redd.it/5dijhlvhp1k41.jpg,reddit,"Ingredients 

1.5kg whole chicken

1 teaspoon onion powder 

1 teaspoon garlic powder 

1 teaspoon dried thyme 

1 teaspoon chicken salt or pinch of salt

50g butter 

4 garlic cloves crushed

2 tablespoons olive oil 

1/2 cup white wine 

1 lemon slice + 1/2 lemon for stuffing

4 white onions quartered 

Salt

Pepper

1 teaspoon arrowroot powder (optional) 

Fresh parsley (optional)

Method. 

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees celcius.

Pat your chicken dry with a paper towel. 

To make the garlic butter, mash the garlic thyme, garlic and onion powder and chicken salt or a pinch of salt into the butter with a fork. The butter should be at room temperature so you can easily mix through the garlic and spices. 

Place the chicken into a large baking tray and sprinkle a generous amount of salt onto and inside the cavity of the chicken. 

Massage the garlic butter onto the skin of the chicken and also underneath the skin of the chicken. This can be done by separating the skin from the chicken with your fingers. Pour the white wine and olive oil over the chicken (this will prevent the butter from burning). Stuff the bum of the chicken with half a lemon and a handful of fresh parsley.  

Place the onions and lemon slices around and underneath the chicken for it to sit on. Pour some olive oil and sprinkle some salt onto them. 

Place your chicken into the oven and cook for 1hr 20mins. You can check if your chicken is cooked by placing a skewer into the centre of the chicken. If the liquid comes out clear your chicken is cooked. If the liquid is pink it will need a little more time cooking. For the last 5 minutes of cooking turn the ovens temperature all the way up. This will help get the skin extra crispy and brown. 

Once the chicken is cooked set it to the side and let it rest. Pour the juices from the baking tray into a pan and stir through the arrowroot powder on a low - medium heat on the stove top for several minutes until the sauce has thickened. 

Finish off by sprinkling fresh parsley onto the chicken and pouring over the gravy.

**3.** Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces (I used scale) and shape each one into a ball and flatten slightly. Place on the 2 baking trays covered with baking paper and allow to rise for another hour (you can oil your hand lightly to make working with the dough easier).

**4.** When proofed, brush with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds then bake the buns in a 190C (375F) oven for around 15 minutes or until golden brown.

**5.** Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack, brush with melted butter.

**Method for the sauce and onions:**

**1.** Saute the onions on a medium heated frying pan for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. When almost ready season with a little bit of salt. You can place them in a small dish covered with tin foil ready for later.

**2.** For the sauce mix all the ingredients together, if you don't have liquid smoke, you can add meat juices from the pan.

**Method for the beef patty:**

**1.** Chop the minced beef with the knife and place in the bowl.

**2.** Add remaining ingredients and mix together.

**3.** Divide the meat into 8 pieces and shape the flat round patties.

**4.** Heat the frying pan to medium-high heat and place the patty, once nicely coloured on one side flip it upside down and place a slice of cheese at the top, cover frying pan with a lid (this helps to melt the cheese). When ready place straight into a burger.

**5.** Enjoy this delicious burger!

**Ingredients**

2 tablespoons of butter  
½ medium-sized onion, chopped  
1/2 cup finely chopped sweet pepper (Bell, Anaheim, Hungarian Sweet, etc.), chopped  
1 jalapeno, minced (optional)  
3 cloves of garlic, minced  
2 large ripe tomatoes, chopped  
⅛ teaspoon smoked paprika  
Salt and pepper to taste  
½ cup shredded mozzarella, divided in halves  
2 large eggs  
Parsley and mint for garnish  
Soft, crusty bread, or pide for serving  


**Directions**

1. If you don’t mind the tomato skins, feel free to skip this part! Place the tomatoes into a pot of boiling water for 30 seconds. Then, place into a bowl of ice water to cool down and prevent further cooking. The tomatoes should then be very easy to peel and chop. Set aside.
2. In a medium-size deep skillet, over medium heat, toss in the butter. Once melted, add in the red onion and pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, or until very soft.
3. Toss in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
4. Then, stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Uncover, and mash the tomatoes with the back of the spoon. Season with smoked paprika, salt, and pepper before adding in ¼ cup of the mozzarella.
6. Stir the cheese a few times and add in the eggs.
7. Turn the heat down to medium-low and stir everything around just until combined. Cook for 3-5 more minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your preference.
8. Sprinkle on the remaining ¼ cup of cheese and let this melt before serving with a lovely loaf of soft, crusty bread. Enjoy!"

* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 4 tbsp oil
* 1/4 cup glutinous rice flour (for dusting)

Optional: brown sugar boba!

* 1 cup boba
* 1/4 cup brown sugar

&#x200B;

Instructions

Milk Tea Custard

1. Pour the milk and sugar into a small saucepot and place over medium  heat until just barely boiling (it should not foam over and remember to  constantly stir so nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot!)
2. Remove from heat and then pour in the black tea leaves and cover with a lid
3. Allow the tea leaves to steep in the milk for \~7 minutes 
4. In a small bowl, combine the flour and cornstarch
5. In another bowl, whisk together the egg yolks
6. Pour the dry ingredients into the whisked egg yolks and mix until combined
7. Once the tea is done steeping, strain out the leaves and then slowly  pour in the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, and  whisk together
8. Keep pouring in the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture until all of  the milk is incorporated and you end up with a thin, smooth custard  base
9. Pour this custard into a small saucepot and place over medium heat 
10. Constantly stir the custard until it thickens (\~5-10 minutes)
11. Keep stirring the custard over heat until you're able to see the  bottom of the pot (custard will just magically thicken at some time  point so keep watch!)
12. Remove from heat and stir in the butter until it is fully incorporated
13. Transfer the custard to a deep plate and cover with plastic wrap  (push the plastic wrap down so that it touches the top of the custard)
14. Then refrigerate until completely cooled (1-2 hours)

Snow Skin Wrapper

1. In a medium bowl, combine the dry ingredients (glutinous rice flour, rice flour, cornstarch, and powdered sugar)
2. In a small bowl, combine the wet ingredients (milk and oil)
3. Slowly pour the wet ingredients from the small bowl, into the dry  ingredients in the medium bowl and stir until it is well combined (the  resultant mixture should be quite thin)
4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a steamer for \~20 minutes
5. After 15 minutes, insert a knife into the dough and if it comes out  clean with the dough feeling firm, then it is ready to remove (if not,  allow to steam for a couple more minutes)
6. Remove the bowl from the steamer and allow to cool for 5 minutes
7. Transfer the dough to a cleaned surface and knead by hand until it  is smooth and no longer sticky (no extra oil or flour should be needed)
8. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until cool to the touch

Brown Sugar Boba

1. Boil the boba balls in a small sauce pot for 30 minutes
2. Drain out the liquid and then pour in the brown sugar and stir until it has all melted
3. Allow the boba to soak in the brown sugar for 10 minutes

Assembly

1. Place the remaining 1/4 cup of glutinous rice flour into a small pan  and toast over medium heat until it starts to smell nutty and turns  slightly brown
2. Remove from heat and reserve for dusting later
3. While the dough chills in the fridge, remove the cooled milk tea custard
4. Form the custard into balls by taking a heaping tablespoon of each  and shaping it with your hands (optionally fill the centers of the  custard balls with brown sugar boba!)
5. Once all the custard balls are formed, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the mooncake dough is cooled
6. Remove the mooncake dough from the fridge and shape it into 1 tablespoon round balls as well
7. Take a dough ball and place it onto a clean surface
8. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a \~4in disk
9. Place a custard ball in the center of the dough and wrap the skin around the custard, creating a nice seal at the base
10. Roll the mooncake ball around in the toasted glutinous rice flour and shake off any excess
11. Lightly dust the inside of your mooncake mold with the toasted glutinous rice flour
12. Place the mooncake ball into the mold, seam side away from the pattern and press firmly into the mold
13. Remove and then repeat the above steps with the rest of the dough balls
14. Keep these mooncakes refrigerated in an airtight container as they're best served cold!

Here is the hopefully correctly written recipe!



**Ingredients:**

*For the shortcrust pastry:*

* 300 g flour
* 100 g butter
* 50 g brown sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 2 eggs

*For the filling:*

* 1,5 kg apples
* 50 g butter
* 50 g raisins
* up to 30 g sugar, depends on how sweet your apples are
* Vanilla pudding (I used vanilla pudding powder and 500ml milk)

*For the cover:*

* 100g sugar
* 150g flour
*  125g butter (you can also use less butter, 100g, then it becomes a crumbly dough)

&#x200B;

**Steps:**

1. Make shortcrust pastry with the listed ingredients. Let rest for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile peel apples, remove seeds and dice. Then heat and boil in a pot with the butter, raisins and, if necessary, sugar until the juice has completely dried out and a firm mass is formed.
3. Prepare a pack of vanilla pudding according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Meanwhile, mix the ingredients for the cover. I preferred the firm, smooth one over the crumbles.
5. Roll out the short pastry and put it in a greased springform pan, press up against the rim about 3 cm. Spread vanilla pudding on it and put apples in.
6. For the cover, either pluck the firm dough and spread it on top, crush it a little with your fingers or. In the case of crumbly dough, simply place it on top of the apple filling to cover.
7. Bake in the preheated oven at 160 degrees top/bottom heat for 50 minutes. Then turn up to 200 degrees for an additional 5-10 minutes so that the crumble cover turns brown. Stay next to the oven until the desired browning is achieved to prevent burning.
8. Hardest part: Allow to cool properly before serving."

Sauce Pan

Skillet (or two to make this easier)



**COOKING TIME**
Prep: 5 mins

Cook: 10 mins

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 Cup Oats
* 500ml Stock (I used Mushroom)
* 2 cloves garlic (substitute with garlic paste if you wish)
* 1 Spring Onion
* 3 Spring Green leaves
* 210g Mushrooms
* 1/4 Block Extra firm tofu
* 1 tsp Miso Paste (optional)
* Soy Sauce
* Sriracha to marinate the Tofu
* Sesame Togarashi

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Prepare your stock, I used a mushroom stock cube with 500ML of water.
1. Add your oats to the sauce pan and 1/2 of the stock, in a minute or two add the remaining stock until you reach your desired consistency.
1. Roll the spring greens tightly and chop in to 2mm slices.
1. Chop your protein, I used extra firm tofu
1. Slice the spring onion, larges pieces for more bite, smaller if you wish.
1. Slice your mushrooms.
1. Slice or mush your garlic, an added step might be to lightly fry the garlic for added crispy texture if you slice it..
1. Add the mushrooms to the skillet on medium/high heat and begin cooking them down, as they begin to shrink add some soy sauce and let the shrooms absorb it.
1. Toss the greens to the pan with the shrooms, add a little soy sauce and continue to toss until cooked, add a drizzle of water and the garlic, this should take around 5 minutes.
1. Whilst cooking your veggies, begin cooking your protein in a separate pan.


Around 2-3 minutes later, everything should be cooked.


**TO SERVE**

Add the oats to the bowl, followed by the greens and tofu, finish with some sesame seeds or Togarashi.

Recipe:

## INGREDIENTS – FOR 2 PERSONS –

* **200 gr flour 00**
* **2 large eggs**

## INSTRUCTIONS

**Place the flour in a large cutting board, or in your kitchen counter-top. Make a well in the middle of it, while trying to shape the flour as a volcano.**

**In the center of the well, add the eggs one by one and start whisking using a fork. When the eggs are well combined, start adding the flour from inside the well and mixing in the same time, until the dough gets thicker.**

**At this point, use your hands to form a round shaped dough, then start kneading the dough for 8 to 10 minutes.**

**Form the dough into a bowl, wrap it gently in a plastic bag and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, ideally 6 hours or up to 1 day refrigerated.**

***The rolling :***

**Make sure your kitchen counter-top or your cutting board is clean and dry.**

**Spread some flour on the surface, place your dough on the center and roll it out, turn the dough clockwise each time you roll it by 90 degrees, and keep rolling until it reaches 1 or 2 mm of thickness, you should be able to see your hand through the dough.**

***The cutting:***

**Fold the dough into 4 keeping its length intact but decreasing its width, then start to cut your pasta into 1 cm stripes, open them and sprinkle some flour on top of the stripes so that the pasts doesn’t not stick together.**

***The cooking:***

**Fresh pasta cooks quickly, you simply need to bring water to a boil over high heat in a large pot. Add in salt (about 1 teaspoon), and the fresh pasta, cook for 90 seconds, with stirring frequently. Check if your pasta is ready but tasting one, then transfer to a colander.**"

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/julia-childs-beef-bourguignon-recipe-simplified/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/julia-childs-beef-bourguignon-recipe-simplified/)

### INGREDIENTS 

* 2-1/2 lbs beef chuck shoulder, cut into 1” cubes
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 6 oz bacon, cut into 1"" squares (1-1/2 c)
* 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1-1/2 c carrots, cut into 1"" pieces
* 1-1/2 c yellow onions or shallots, roughly chopped
* 2 c dry red wine like Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 2 c beef stock or bouillon
* 2 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp dried thyme or a couple fresh sprigs
* 2 bay leaves (remove before serving)
* 10 pearl onions (optional, but nice addition)

#### Mushrooms

* 10 oz cremini (button) mushrooms, quartered or halved, depending on size
* 2 Tbsp butter (or more as necessary)
* 2 Tbsp garlic, minced
* Olive oil as needed
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Additional Ingredients

* 4 Tbsp flat leaf Italian parsley, chopped
* 1 lb egg noodles

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Heat 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium heat.
* Add the bacon (it should sizzle). Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. 
* Add beef cubes (make sure they sizzle when touching the oil) and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
* Add carrots and onion (or shallots) and stir for about 3 minutes. Season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper.
* Add the cooked bacon and browned beef cubes, add 2 Tbsp flour, give it a really good stir, and cook for 2 minutes. 
* Add 2 cups red wine, 2 cups beef stock, 2 Tbsp tomato paste, thyme, bay leaves, and pearl onions. Bring to a boil. Stir and reduce to a simmer. Now, it’s time to put the lid on. 
* Stir every 15 minutes or so to make sure you’ve got a good simmer going and nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. 
* After about 1-1/2 hours, it should be ready, or close to it. Now is a good time to taste. Don’t sweat it if it still seems a little strong on the wine taste. It’ll mellow. But make sure it doesn’t need any more kosher salt. 
* Now that the beef bourguignon is almost ready, we’re going to sauté the mushrooms. In a large frying pan over medium heat, melt 2 Tbsp butter until it slightly bubbles and foams. 
* Add minced garlic for just 30 seconds (you want them fragrant but not burned) and add the mushrooms. 
* Stir, add a little olive oil (or more butter) if you think the mushrooms are too dry). Season with a pinch of kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes.
* Add the sautéed mushroom-garlic-butter mixture to the Dutch oven and give it one more last stir.
* Serve over your favorite side dish. In my case, that’s buttered extra-wide egg noodles.
* Sprinkle with chopped parsley and pour everyone a nice glass of red wine. "

If you don't have saffron, you can just omit it. The dish is kind of a blank canvas, so you could infuse really any flavor you like. Try adding garam masala, turmeric, ras el hanout, or baharat to the butter before adding the rice. You could also do more savory flavors like sage or thyme. A sprinkle of poultry season instead of saffron would be good too! The fig adds a nice subtle sweetness that pairs with just about anything.

**Ingredients:**

* Pinch of saffron
* 3 tablespoons warm water
* 1 cup basmati rice
* 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil, divided
* 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 tablespoon fig jam or use 1 tablespoon chopped dry figs
* 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or use crushed red pepper and smoked paprika to taste
* 2 cups water or vegetable stock
* Salt and pepper to taste
* For serving:
* Crushed pistachios, torn mint leaves, minced parsley, and lemon

**Method:**

**Prepare the saffron and rice:**

* Crush the saffron between your hands or lightly mash it with the back of a spoon in a small bowl. Pour 3 tablespoons of warm water on top. Set aside.
* Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly and set aside.

**Fry the chicken:**

* Pat the chicken dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.
* Heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5–6 minutes until the skin turns golden brown and becomes very crispy. Flip and cook for 5 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.

**Prepare the rice:**

* Turn the heat on the pot to medium. Melt the butter into the rendered chicken fat. Add the onion and cook for 6–7 minutes until it softens. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
* Add the fig jam and the silk chili flakes. Cook for 1 minute.
* Add the rinsed rice to the pot and toss to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until it begins to toast. Season well with salt and pepper.

**Cook the chicken and rice:**

* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Stir the rice and reduce the heat to low. Pour the saffron water into the pot and nestle the chicken on top. Cover and simmer for 25–30 minutes or until the rice is tender and the chicken reaches 165ºF on an instant-read thermometer. Turn off the heat and let stand for 5–10 minutes.

**Broil the chicken, optional:**

* Remove the cover from the pot and turn on the broiler. Drizzle the chicken with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place under the broiler and broil the chicken for 2–3 minutes to crisp up the skin. Remove from the broiler.

**To serve:**

* Scatter crushed pistachios, torn mint leaves, and minced parsley on top. Squeeze a wedge or two of lemon on top.
* Divide the rice and a chicken thigh between plates. Enjoy!"

Edit: here's the text of the recipe:
INGREDIENTS

1/2 cup whole milk

1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces

1 teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons sugar

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 cup all-purpose flour

6 large eggs

2 1/2 cups heavy cream

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Fit 1 large pastry bag (or a plastic freezer bag with 1/2-inch cut from one bottom corner) with plain 1/2-inch tip.

Bring milk, butter, 1 tsp. sugar, salt, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a medium sauce- pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add flour all at once; reduce heat to medium-low. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until a dough forms and pulls away from sides of pan, 1–2 minutes. Continue beating vigorously until a thin dry film forms on bottom and sides of pot, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and let cool a few minutes.

Add 1 egg and stir vigorously with wooden spoon until egg is incorporated and dough looks dry again, about 2 minutes. Repeat with 4 more eggs, adding one at a time and stirring vigorously to incorporate before adding the next. Dough should be smooth, shiny, and thickened.

Spoon dough into prepared pastry bag; pipe out 2 1/2-inch-diameter rounds on pre- pared sheets, leaving 2 inches between rounds. 

Arrange racks in upper and middle thirds of oven and preheat to 450°. Whisk remaining egg with 2 tsp. water and brush dough rounds all over with egg wash.

Transfer baking sheets to oven; turn oven off. After 10 minutes, heat oven to 350° and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate pans front to back and top to bottom; continue baking until deep golden brown all over, about 10 minutes longer (puffs will deflate if removed from oven before fully baked). Transfer puffs to a wire rack and let cool completely.

Using a serrated knife, gently slice the top quarter off each puff; transfer tops to a plate. With your finger, gently push down the soft film of cooked dough inside each puff.

Prepare a second pastry bag (or freezer bag) with 1/2-inch open-star tip. Beat heavy cream and remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Spoon whipped cream into prepared pastry bag. Fill each puff with cream, "

\- 10g ginger

\- 1 green onion

\- 2 star anises

\- 1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns

\- 1 tbsp salt

\- 1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine

\- 3g salt

\- 3g sugar

\- 400ml beer or water

&#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Any white fish such as tilapia, sea bass or red snapper will be a good choice. Gut and descale the fish. Gently score the fish 7 to 8 times on each side, then marinate it for at least an hour.
2. Prepare your favorite vegetables to eat with the fish. Chop some garlic and green onions for later use.
3. Preheat the oven to 475 ^(o)F. Pat the fish dry with a paper towel and place the fish on top of a rack. Brush on a generous amount of chili oil to keep in the meat’s moisture as well as prevent the fish from sticking on the rack. Sprinkle spices such as chili powder, Sichuan peppercorn powder, cumin, and salt on the surface of the fish skin and inside the belly.
4. Bake the fish for 15 minutes and then broil it for 3 minutes.
5. Stir fry the vegetables for about 3 minutes using medium to high heat. Add some salt and sugar near the end. Place the veggies in the oven dish.
6. To make the chili soup, first stir fry the chili bean sauce in the oil for about 40 seconds until you see the oil becomes red. Then add the dried chilies, chili powder, Sichuan peppercorn powder, and five spices one by one, so you will be able to experience the multiple layers of flavors. Add 400ml beer or water or chicken broth if you don’t drink alcohol. Cover it with a lid and let it boil for about 5 minutes.
7. Place the baked fish on top of the veggies and pour the chili soup into the oven dish. Spread some chopped garlic and dried chilis on the fish. Pour some hot oil over the fish to release their fragrances. Bake the entire dish at 400 ^(o)F for 5 more minutes. Enjoy!"

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

* 1 pound good-quality bacon diced
* 1 medium (roughly 1/2 pound) yellow onion chopped
* 2 large garlic cloves minced
* ¼ cup real maple syrup
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* ¼ cup brewed black coffee
* ¼ cup dark brown sugar packed
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. In a medium pan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crispy (typically about 10-15 minutes depending on fat content).
2. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon to a separate bowl. Drain the bacon fat out of the pan, leaving the drippings (the tiny bacon pieces in the bottom of the pan).
3. Add the onion and garlic. Sauté over medium-high heat for 3 minutes until fragrant.
4. Add maple syrup, cider vinegar, black coffee, brown sugar, the bacon, salt and a generous amount of black pepper. Stir.
5. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, for 50-60 minutes. Stir occasionally. Jam is ready when the mixture thickens and resembles a syrupy, chunky jam. Keep in mind that the jam will thicken more when cooled, and you want some liquid so the jam isn’t dry!
6. Serve warm or room temperature."

4. Broil for 5 minutes. Use tongs to flip over the tomatillos and jalapeño halves.
5. Watching carefully, broil for another 3-6 minutes. The tomatillo skins should be lightly charred and should loosen a bit, just starting to fall apart.
6. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. While cooling, add onion, cilantro, garlic, and lime juice to a blender.
7. Add one or both of the jalapeño halves depending on your desired heat level. Add all of the tomatillos and any juice left on the pan.

4. Right before the steak is done, you can stir in the reserved marinade if you like, and cook for one minute. Add the potatoes back to the pan and heat through. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.  
5. Remove from heat and serve immediately, garnished with more crushed chili pepper, fresh herbs, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the potatoes if you like. Enjoy!

Ingredients

* 3/4 cups butter unsalted, melted
* 1 cup brown sugar packed
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 large egg yolk
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 1/4 cup flour all-purpose
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 cup macadamia nuts roughly chopped, optionally roasted\*
* 1 cup white chocolate chips

Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 350F. Add the butter and both sugars to a large mixing bowl and cream together until smooth. Add the whole egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, then continue to beat until light, with the sugars mostly dissolved.
* Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into the mixing bowl. Mix just until you no longer see any flour, then scrape down the sides with a spatula and fold in any remaining dry ingredients. Fold in the macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips.
* Prepare a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out \~2 tbsp-sized balls of dough and line them on the baking sheet, with room for them to spread. Transfer the sheet pan to the fridge for 10-15 minutes, just until the dough is cool.
* Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges begin to turn golden. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 10 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.

Notes

\*To roast the macadamia nuts:

1. Preheat the oven to 325F. Add the macadamia nuts to a sheet pan in a single layer.
2. Roast the nuts for 10-15 minutes, or until golden. Take them out of the oven to toss every 3-4 minutes to ensure they brown evenly."

It's really simple to make and requires only a little prep time. The hardest part is finding Holy basil! I'm based in the UK where I can find it from Chinatown in London - I'm not sure of it's availability in the US but I'm sure East Asian grocers will stock in in places or it can be ordered online. If you can't find holy basil, it's better to use normal Italian basil instead as opposed to using Thai basil which has a aniseedy flavour.

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 10 mins

Total Time: 30 mins

Servings: 1

###### EQUIPMENT

- Wok or Large Frying Pan

###### INGREDIENTS

• 150g chicken thigh, cut into chunks

• 2 tbs veg oil 

• 2 tbs oyster sauce⁣  
• 8 birdseye chillies  
• 4 cloves of garlic  
• 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce  
• 1/2 tsp light soy sauce

Here is a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLfJA6ppiEh/) of the cooking process (NB if you don't have Instagram give me a shout and I can upload to imgur). Otherwise below are detailed steps on how to make this dish.  
  

###### INSTRUCTIONS 

- Marinate the chicken in oyster sauce for at least 30 mins - this will help tenderise the meat.
- Pound chillies and garlic into a coarse paste using a mortar and pestle. If you dont have a mortar and pestle, finely chopping each is fine. 
- In a hot wok or large frying pan, add veg oil and then chicken, stir fry over high heat for about 4 minutes until chicken is about 80% cooked through.
- Add chillies and garlic, stir fry for 1 min 
- Season with dark and light soy and pinch of sugar.
- Turn heat down, add holy basil and fold it through until just wilted. Serve on top of freshly cooked jasmine rice
- In a hot frying pan or wok add plenty of oil and fry egg until crispy but still soft yolk (about 2 mins). Add egg on top of rice and chicken. 

###### TO SERVE

- This dish is spicy and there is nothing better to accompany it then an ice cold beer!"

Check out my recipe Video and Channel!-> [https://youtu.be/CjfRfu98tfI](https://youtu.be/CjfRfu98tfI)

Recipe:

Fragrant Oil

* Vegetable Oil (2 cups)
* Scallions (8 only roots and ends)
* Shallot (1)

Buns

* All-Purpose Flour ( 500 grams )
* Sugar ( 1/2 tsp)
* Yeast ( 5 grams)
* Water (290 gra
* Salt ( 1 Tbl+)
* White Pepper (1 tsp)
* Fragrant Oil ( 2 tbl)
* Scallions ( 4-6 depending on size)

Instructions:

Fragrant Oil- Cut the roots and ends of scallions and finely chop one shallot. Simmer in vegetable oil until golden brown (20 minutes on low heat) then store and use when ready.

&#x200B;

1. Prepare a cup with water, sugar and yeast and let bloom for 10 minutes. Then mix flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl and mix in the water mixture, in increments while stirring. Knead for 7-10 minutes, then coat with oil, cover and let rise for 1.5 - 2 hours.
2. Take dough out and knead for another 3 minutes. Dust the workspace and then create an initial rectangle shape with your hands. Using a rolling pin, roll up and down evenly then rotate horizontally. Roll out each side until you get an even sheet with a decent thickness.
3. Put in salt, white pepper and fragrant oil on the sheet and distribute evenly. Then put on diced scallions and spread all the ingredients equally across the dough. Slowly roll upwards into a spiral shape, carefully and being sure to tuck it in to keep it secure and tight. Should be about 5 full rotations.
4. Stretch out the dough a bit and cut into inch-width pieces. To make the shape: with a chopstick, push down the middle, flip it over and place the chopstick on the bottom using it as a center to rotate around. Rotate the piece all the way until you reach the end. Push down with the chopstick and quickly take it out.
5. Place your Buns in a steamer and let it rise again for another 20-30 minutes prior to cooking. You want to see a size increase and a bouncy dough. Then Steam for 10 minutes."

Chocolate Diplomat Cream Layer

1 cup milk

1/2 tbsp vanilla

3 egg yolks

1/3 cup sugar

1/8 cup cornstarch

1/2 tbsp unsalted butter

1/4 cup chocolate chips

1 and 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Instructions

Add the milk to a medium saucepan, place over medium heat and bring to a boil.

In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk until smooth.

Whisk the hot milk gradually into the egg mixture until incorporated.

Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened. You know it is done when you can run a wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan, and it leaves a clean line.

Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate chips and butter until melted. Let cool slightly. 

Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming.

Chill about an hour.

Once chilled, whip up the heavy cream until thick and you can overturn the bowl without any cream falling out. Remember not to over-whip.

Fold the whipped into the chocolate pastry cream.

Brownie Layer

2 cups semisweet chopped chocolate or chocolate chips

1/2 cup butter

1/2 cup light brown sugar

4 large eggs

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/4 teaspoon salt

1 cup all purpose flour

Instructions

Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a 9×9 baking dish with parchment, and grease with oil. Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, cook butter over medium heat until melted and browned, stirring constantly. It should take about 4 minutes. You will see it change color and aroma with brown bits forming at the bottom. Immediately take it off the heat and pour over the chocolate chips.

Let the mixture sit to allow the chocolate chips to melt and then stir until no more chunks of chocolate remain. Whisk in the brown sugar.

Next add the eggs and whisk until evenly combined. Next mix in the vanilla until smooth. Stir in the salt and flour until they’re evenly incorporated. Then pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake the brownies for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Let the brownies cool completely and cut or crumble into bite-sized pieces.

Whipped Cream Layer

1 and 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Instructions

Whip up the heavy cream until thick and you can overturn the bowl without any cream falling out. Remember not to over-whip.

Assembly

In each glass, place alternating layers of brownie bits, chocolate diplomat cream, and whipped cream. Garnish with shaved chocolate on top."
